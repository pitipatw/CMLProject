It can also be used as paving sub-base, bridge abutment, and retaining wall backfill. Also called Controlled Density Fill (CDF) or Controlled Low Strength Materials (CLSMs).

(high slump) and sets with no compaction. It is often used in tight or restricted access areas where placing and compacting fill is difficult. Applications include filling large voids such as abandoned underground storage tanks, basements, tunnels, mines, and sewers. It can also be used as paving sub-base, bridge abutment, and retaining wall backfill. Also called Controlled Density Fill (CDF) or Controlled Low Strength Materials (CLSMs). These materials typically have compressive strengths under 1200 psi.","declared_unit":"1 m3","pct50_gwp":"123.1396058 kgCO2e","pct30_gwp":"91.39695183

(high slump) and sets with no compaction. It is often used in tight or restricted access areas where placing and compacting fill is difficult. Applications include filling large voids such as abandoned underground storage tanks, basements, tunnels, mines, and sewers. It can also be used as paving sub-base, bridge abutment, and retaining wall backfill. Also called Controlled Density Fill (CDF) or Controlled Low Strength Materials (CLSMs).

(high slump) and sets with no compaction. It is often used in tight or restricted access areas where placing and compacting fill is difficult. Applications include filling large voids such as abandoned underground storage tanks, basements, tunnels, mines, and sewers. It can also be used as paving sub-base, bridge abutment, and retaining wall backfill. Also called Controlled Density Fill (CDF) or Controlled Low Strength Materials (CLSMs). These materials typically have compressive strengths under 1200 psi.","declared_unit":"1 m3","pct50_gwp":"123.1396058 kgCO2e","pct30_gwp":"91.39695183

Ready Mixed Concrete is bought and sold by volume - usually expressed in cubic meters. RMX can be custom-made to suit different applications. The commercial applications of Ready-Mix Concrete cover a wide range: from foundation, flooring, car parking, access roads, terracing, frames, stairs, lift shafts, to major infrastructure works, hydro-technical constructions, etc. All the grades from M5 to M80 were considered for calculating the average Ready-Mix Concrete representative of ACC Limited. The average ready-mix concrete is based on the weighted average production volume of each plant.

(high slump) and sets with no compaction. It is often used in tight or restricted access areas where placing and compacting fill is difficult. Applications include filling large voids such as abandoned underground storage tanks, basements, tunnels, mines, and sewers. It can also be used as paving sub-base, bridge abutment, and retaining wall backfill. Also called Controlled Density Fill (CDF) or Controlled Low Strength Materials (CLSMs).

Ready Mixed Concrete is bought and sold by volume - usually expressed in cubic meters. RMX can be custom-made to suit different applications. The commercial applications of Ready-Mix Concrete cover a wide range: from foundation, flooring, car parking, access roads, terracing, frames, stairs, lift shafts, to major infrastructure works, hydro-technical constructions, etc. All the grades from M5 to M80 were considered for calculating the average Ready-Mix Concrete representative of ACC Limited. The average ready-mix concrete is based on the weighted average production volume of each plant. All the RMX ‘Value Added Solutions’ (VAS) like ACC Adhar, ACC Bucketcrete, ACC Colourcrete, ACC Column 4, ACC Coolcrete, ACC Ecocrete, ACC Feathercrete, ACC Fibercrete, ACC Flowcrete, ACC Imprintcrete, ACC Jetsetcrete, ACC Neev, ACC Supercoat, ACC Supercrete, ACC Suraksha, ACC UTWT, ACC Sustainocrete are included in the overall grade production volume considered in the study.

(high slump) and sets with no compaction. It is often used in tight or restricted access areas where placing and compacting fill is difficult. Applications include filling large voids such as abandoned underground storage tanks, basements, tunnels, mines, and sewers. It can also be used as paving sub-base, bridge abutment, and retaining wall backfill. Also called Controlled Density Fill (CDF) or Controlled Low Strength Materials (CLSMs).

(high slump) and sets with no compaction. It is often used in tight or restricted access areas where placing and compacting fill is difficult. Applications include filling large voids such as abandoned underground storage tanks, basements, tunnels, mines, and sewers. It can also be used as paving sub-base, bridge abutment, and retaining wall backfill. Also called Controlled Density Fill (CDF) or Controlled Low Strength Materials (CLSMs). These materials typically have compressive strengths under 1200 psi.","declared_unit":"1 m3","pct50_gwp":"123.1396058 kgCO2e","pct30_gwp":"91.39695183

(high slump) and sets with no compaction. It is often used in tight or restricted access areas where placing and compacting fill is difficult. Applications include filling large voids such as abandoned underground storage tanks, basements, tunnels, mines, and sewers. It can also be used as paving sub-base, bridge abutment, and retaining wall backfill. Also called Controlled Density Fill (CDF) or Controlled Low Strength Materials (CLSMs). These materials typically have compressive strengths under 1200 psi.","declared_unit":"1 m3","pct50_gwp":"123.1396058 kgCO2e","pct30_gwp":"91.39695183

(high slump) and sets with no compaction. It is often used in tight or restricted access areas where placing and compacting fill is difficult. Applications include filling large voids such as abandoned underground storage tanks, basements, tunnels, mines, and sewers. It can also be used as paving sub-base, bridge abutment, and retaining wall backfill. Also called Controlled Density Fill (CDF) or Controlled Low Strength Materials (CLSMs).

It is often used in tight or restricted access areas where placing and compacting fill is difficult. Applications include filling large voids such as abandoned underground storage tanks, basements, tunnels, mines, and sewers. It can also be used as paving sub-base, bridge abutment, and retaining wall backfill. Also called Controlled Density Fill (CDF) or Controlled Low Strength Materials (CLSMs).

(high slump) and sets with no compaction. It is often used in tight or restricted access areas where placing and compacting fill is difficult. Applications include filling large voids such as abandoned underground storage tanks, basements, tunnels, mines, and sewers. It can also be used as paving sub-base, bridge abutment, and retaining wall backfill. Also called Controlled Density Fill (CDF) or Controlled Low Strength Materials (CLSMs). These materials typically have compressive strengths under 1200 psi.","declared_unit":"1 m3","pct50_gwp":"123.1396058 kgCO2e","pct30_gwp":"91.39695183

(high slump) and sets with no compaction. It is often used in tight or restricted access areas where placing and compacting fill is difficult. Applications include filling large voids such as abandoned underground storage tanks, basements, tunnels, mines, and sewers. It can also be used as paving sub-base, bridge abutment, and retaining wall backfill. Also called Controlled Density Fill (CDF) or Controlled Low Strength Materials (CLSMs). These materials typically have compressive strengths under 1200 psi.","declared_unit":"1 m3","pct50_gwp":"123.1396058 kgCO2e","pct30_gwp":"91.39695183

(high slump) and sets with no compaction. It is often used in tight or restricted access areas where placing and compacting fill is difficult. Applications include filling large voids such as abandoned underground storage tanks, basements, tunnels, mines, and sewers. It can also be used as paving sub-base, bridge abutment, and retaining wall backfill. Also called Controlled Density Fill (CDF) or Controlled Low Strength Materials (CLSMs).

(high slump) and sets with no compaction. It is often used in tight or restricted access areas where placing and compacting fill is difficult. Applications include filling large voids such as abandoned underground storage tanks, basements, tunnels, mines, and sewers. It can also be used as paving sub-base, bridge abutment, and retaining wall backfill. Also called Controlled Density Fill (CDF) or Controlled Low Strength Materials (CLSMs). These materials typically have compressive strengths under 1200 psi.","declared_unit":"1 m3","pct50_gwp":"123.1396058 kgCO2e","pct30_gwp":"91.39695183

It can also be used as paving sub-base, bridge abutment, and retaining wall backfill. Also called Controlled Density Fill (CDF) or Controlled Low Strength Materials (CLSMs).

(high slump) and sets with no compaction. It is often used in tight or restricted access areas where placing and compacting fill is difficult. Applications include filling large voids such as abandoned underground storage tanks, basements, tunnels, mines, and sewers. It can also be used as paving sub-base, bridge abutment, and retaining wall backfill. Also called Controlled Density Fill (CDF) or Controlled Low Strength Materials (CLSMs). These materials typically have compressive strengths under 1200 psi.","declared_unit":"1 m3","pct50_gwp":"123.1396058 kgCO2e","pct30_gwp":"91.39695183

(high slump) and sets with no compaction. It is often used in tight or restricted access areas where placing and compacting fill is difficult. Applications include filling large voids such as abandoned underground storage tanks, basements, tunnels, mines, and sewers. It can also be used as paving sub-base, bridge abutment, and retaining wall backfill. Also called Controlled Density Fill (CDF) or Controlled Low Strength Materials (CLSMs).

(high slump) and sets with no compaction. It is often used in tight or restricted access areas where placing and compacting fill is difficult. Applications include filling large voids such as abandoned underground storage tanks, basements, tunnels, mines, and sewers. It can also be used as paving sub-base, bridge abutment, and retaining wall backfill. Also called Controlled Density Fill (CDF) or Controlled Low Strength Materials (CLSMs). These materials typically have compressive strengths under 1200 psi.","declared_unit":"1 m3","pct50_gwp":"123.1396058 kgCO2e","pct30_gwp":"91.39695183

(high slump) and sets with no compaction. It is often used in tight or restricted access areas where placing and compacting fill is difficult. Applications include filling large voids such as abandoned underground storage tanks, basements, tunnels, mines, and sewers. It can also be used as paving sub-base, bridge abutment, and retaining wall backfill. Also called Controlled Density Fill (CDF) or Controlled Low Strength Materials (CLSMs). These materials typically have compressive strengths under 1200 psi.","declared_unit":"1 m3","pct50_gwp":"123.1396058 kgCO2e","pct30_gwp":"91.39695183

(high slump) and sets with no compaction. It is often used in tight or restricted access areas where placing and compacting fill is difficult. Applications include filling large voids such as abandoned underground storage tanks, basements, tunnels, mines, and sewers. It can also be used as paving sub-base, bridge abutment, and retaining wall backfill. Also called Controlled Density Fill (CDF) or Controlled Low Strength Materials (CLSMs). These materials typically have compressive strengths under 1200 psi.","declared_unit":"1 m3","pct50_gwp":"123.1396058 kgCO2e","pct30_gwp":"91.39695183

(high slump) and sets with no compaction. It is often used in tight or restricted access areas where placing and compacting fill is difficult. Applications include filling large voids such as abandoned underground storage tanks, basements, tunnels, mines, and sewers. It can also be used as paving sub-base, bridge abutment, and retaining wall backfill. Also called Controlled Density Fill (CDF) or Controlled Low Strength Materials (CLSMs).

(high slump) and sets with no compaction. It is often used in tight or restricted access areas where placing and compacting fill is difficult. Applications include filling large voids such as abandoned underground storage tanks, basements, tunnels, mines, and sewers. It can also be used as paving sub-base, bridge abutment, and retaining wall backfill. Also called Controlled Density Fill (CDF) or Controlled Low Strength Materials (CLSMs). These materials typically have compressive strengths under 1200 psi.","declared_unit":"1 m3","pct50_gwp":"123.1396058 kgCO2e","pct30_gwp":"91.39695183

(high slump) and sets with no compaction. It is often used in tight or restricted access areas where placing and compacting fill is difficult. Applications include filling large voids such as abandoned underground storage tanks, basements, tunnels, mines, and sewers. It can also be used as paving sub-base, bridge abutment, and retaining wall backfill. Also called Controlled Density Fill (CDF) or Controlled Low Strength Materials (CLSMs).

(high slump) and sets with no compaction. It is often used in tight or restricted access areas where placing and compacting fill is difficult. Applications include filling large voids such as abandoned underground storage tanks, basements, tunnels, mines, and sewers. It can also be used as paving sub-base, bridge abutment, and retaining wall backfill. Also called Controlled Density Fill (CDF) or Controlled Low Strength Materials (CLSMs). These materials typically have compressive strengths under 1200 psi.","declared_unit":"1 m3","pct50_gwp":"123.1396058 kgCO2e","pct30_gwp":"91.39695183

It can also be used as paving sub-base, bridge abutment, and retaining wall backfill. Also called Controlled Density Fill (CDF) or Controlled Low Strength Materials (CLSMs).

(high slump) and sets with no compaction. It is often used in tight or restricted access areas where placing and compacting fill is difficult. Applications include filling large voids such as abandoned underground storage tanks, basements, tunnels, mines, and sewers. It can also be used as paving sub-base, bridge abutment, and retaining wall backfill. Also called Controlled Density Fill (CDF) or Controlled Low Strength Materials (CLSMs). These materials typically have compressive strengths under 1200 psi.","declared_unit":"1 m3","pct50_gwp":"123.1396058 kgCO2e","pct30_gwp":"91.39695183

(high slump) and sets with no compaction. It is often used in tight or restricted access areas where placing and compacting fill is difficult. Applications include filling large voids such as abandoned underground storage tanks, basements, tunnels, mines, and sewers. It can also be used as paving sub-base, bridge abutment, and retaining wall backfill. Also called Controlled Density Fill (CDF) or Controlled Low Strength Materials (CLSMs).

(high slump) and sets with no compaction. It is often used in tight or restricted access areas where placing and compacting fill is difficult. Applications include filling large voids such as abandoned underground storage tanks, basements, tunnels, mines, and sewers. It can also be used as paving sub-base, bridge abutment, and retaining wall backfill. Also called Controlled Density Fill (CDF) or Controlled Low Strength Materials (CLSMs). These materials typically have compressive strengths under 1200 psi.","declared_unit":"1 m3","pct50_gwp":"123.1396058 kgCO2e","pct30_gwp":"91.39695183

It can also be used as paving sub-base, bridge abutment, and retaining wall backfill. Also called Controlled Density Fill (CDF) or Controlled Low Strength Materials (CLSMs).

(high slump) and sets with no compaction. It is often used in tight or restricted access areas where placing and compacting fill is difficult. Applications include filling large voids such as abandoned underground storage tanks, basements, tunnels, mines, and sewers. It can also be used as paving sub-base, bridge abutment, and retaining wall backfill. Also called Controlled Density Fill (CDF) or Controlled Low Strength Materials (CLSMs). These materials typically have compressive strengths under 1200 psi.","declared_unit":"1 m3","pct50_gwp":"123.1396058 kgCO2e","pct30_gwp":"91.39695183

It can also be used as paving sub-base, bridge abutment, and retaining wall backfill. Also called Controlled Density Fill (CDF) or Controlled Low Strength Materials (CLSMs).

(high slump) and sets with no compaction. It is often used in tight or restricted access areas where placing and compacting fill is difficult. Applications include filling large voids such as abandoned underground storage tanks, basements, tunnels, mines, and sewers. It can also be used as paving sub-base, bridge abutment, and retaining wall backfill. Also called Controlled Density Fill (CDF) or Controlled Low Strength Materials (CLSMs). These materials typically have compressive strengths under 1200 psi.","declared_unit":"1 m3","pct50_gwp":"123.1396058 kgCO2e","pct30_gwp":"91.39695183

(high slump) and sets with no compaction. It is often used in tight or restricted access areas where placing and compacting fill is difficult. Applications include filling large voids such as abandoned underground storage tanks, basements, tunnels, mines, and sewers. It can also be used as paving sub-base, bridge abutment, and retaining wall backfill. Also called Controlled Density Fill (CDF) or Controlled Low Strength Materials (CLSMs).

(high slump) and sets with no compaction. It is often used in tight or restricted access areas where placing and compacting fill is difficult. Applications include filling large voids such as abandoned underground storage tanks, basements, tunnels, mines, and sewers. It can also be used as paving sub-base, bridge abutment, and retaining wall backfill. Also called Controlled Density Fill (CDF) or Controlled Low Strength Materials (CLSMs). These materials typically have compressive strengths under 1200 psi.","declared_unit":"1 m3","pct50_gwp":"123.1396058 kgCO2e","pct30_gwp":"91.39695183
