(high slump) and sets with no compaction. It is often used in tight or restricted access areas where placing and compacting fill is difficult. Applications include filling large voids such as abandoned underground storage tanks, basements, tunnels, mines, and sewers. It can also be used as paving sub-base, bridge abutment, and retaining wall backfill. Also called Controlled Density Fill (CDF) or Controlled Low Strength Materials (CLSMs).

(high slump) and sets with no compaction. It is often used in tight or restricted access areas where placing and compacting fill is difficult. Applications include filling large voids such as abandoned underground storage tanks, basements, tunnels, mines, and sewers. It can also be used as paving sub-base, bridge abutment, and retaining wall backfill. Also called Controlled Density Fill (CDF) or Controlled Low Strength Materials (CLSMs).

(high slump) and sets with no compaction. It is often used in tight or restricted access areas where placing and compacting fill is difficult. Applications include filling large voids such as abandoned underground storage tanks, basements, tunnels, mines, and sewers. It can also be used as paving sub-base, bridge abutment, and retaining wall backfill. Also called Controlled Density Fill (CDF) or Controlled Low Strength Materials (CLSMs). These materials typically have compressive strengths under 1200 psi.","declared_unit":"1 m3","pct50_gwp":"123.1396058 kgCO2e","pct30_gwp":"91.39695183 kgCO2e"},"decking_board_material":null,"frame_material":null,"hurricane_resistant":null,"best_practice":"118.6107702 kgCO2e","uncertainty_adjusted_gwp":"143.3892298 kgCO2e","jacket_material":null,"galvanized":null,"outlet_level_switching":null,"gypsum_thickness":null,"is_downloadable":true,"intended_application":null,"aac_white":null,"concrete_flexion_strength":null,"fire_radiant_panel_rating_astme648":null,"c1157":null,"elevators_rated_load":null,"cold_finished":null,"warnings":{"concrete_aggregate_size_max":["Not specified"],"concrete_max_slump":["Not specified"],"concrete_slump":["Not specified"],"concrete_w_c_ratio":["Not specified"],"pcr":["EPD issued after PCR expiry date.

(high slump) and sets with no compaction. It is often used in tight or restricted access areas where placing and compacting fill is difficult. Applications include filling large voids such as abandoned underground storage tanks, basements, tunnels, mines, and sewers. It can also be used as paving sub-base, bridge abutment, and retaining wall backfill. Also called Controlled Density Fill (CDF) or Controlled Low Strength Materials (CLSMs). These materials typically have compressive strengths under 1200 psi.","declared_unit":"1 m3","pct50_gwp":"123.1396058 kgCO2e","pct30_gwp":"91.39695183 kgCO2e"},"decking_board_material":null,"frame_material":null,"hurricane_resistant":null,"best_practice":"125.854176 kgCO2e","uncertainty_adjusted_gwp":"152.145824 kgCO2e","jacket_material":null,"galvanized":null,"outlet_level_switching":null,"gypsum_thickness":null,"is_downloadable":true,"intended_application":null,"aac_white":null,"concrete_flexion_strength":null,"fire_radiant_panel_rating_astme648":null,"c1157":null,"elevators_rated_load":null,"cold_finished":null,"warnings":{"concrete_aggregate_size_max":["Not specified"],"concrete_max_slump":["Not specified"],"concrete_slump":["Not specified"],"concrete_w_c_ratio":["Not specified"],"pcr":["EPD issued after PCR expiry date.

(high slump) and sets with no compaction. It is often used in tight or restricted access areas where placing and compacting fill is difficult. Applications include filling large voids such as abandoned underground storage tanks, basements, tunnels, mines, and sewers. It can also be used as paving sub-base, bridge abutment, and retaining wall backfill. Also called Controlled Density Fill (CDF) or Controlled Low Strength Materials (CLSMs).

(high slump) and sets with no compaction. It is often used in tight or restricted access areas where placing and compacting fill is difficult. Applications include filling large voids such as abandoned underground storage tanks, basements, tunnels, mines, and sewers. It can also be used as paving sub-base, bridge abutment, and retaining wall backfill. Also called Controlled Density Fill (CDF) or Controlled Low Strength Materials (CLSMs). These materials typically have compressive strengths under 1200 psi.","declared_unit":"1 m3","pct50_gwp":"123.1396058 kgCO2e","pct30_gwp":"91.39695183 kgCO2e"},"decking_board_material":null,"frame_material":null,"hurricane_resistant":null,"best_practice":"69.98940867 kgCO2e","uncertainty_adjusted_gwp":"84.61059133 kgCO2e","jacket_material":null,"galvanized":null,"outlet_level_switching":null,"gypsum_thickness":null,"is_downloadable":true,"intended_application":null,"aac_white":null,"concrete_flexion_strength":null,"fire_radiant_panel_rating_astme648":null,"c1157":null,"elevators_rated_load":null,"cold_finished":null,"warnings":{"concrete_aggregate_size_max":["Not specified"],"concrete_max_slump":["Not specified"],"concrete_slump":["Not specified"],"concrete_w_c_ratio":["Not specified"],"pcr":["EPD issued after PCR expiry date.

(high slump) and sets with no compaction. It is often used in tight or restricted access areas where placing and compacting fill is difficult. Applications include filling large voids such as abandoned underground storage tanks, basements, tunnels, mines, and sewers. It can also be used as paving sub-base, bridge abutment, and retaining wall backfill. Also called Controlled Density Fill (CDF) or Controlled Low Strength Materials (CLSMs). These materials typically have compressive strengths under 1200 psi.","declared_unit":"1 m3","pct50_gwp":"123.1396058 kgCO2e","pct30_gwp":"91.39695183 kgCO2e"},"decking_board_material":null,"frame_material":null,"hurricane_resistant":null,"best_practice":"55.23096932 kgCO2e","uncertainty_adjusted_gwp":"66.76903068 kgCO2e","jacket_material":null,"galvanized":null,"outlet_level_switching":null,"gypsum_thickness":null,"is_downloadable":true,"intended_application":null,"aac_white":null,"concrete_flexion_strength":null,"fire_radiant_panel_rating_astme648":null,"c1157":null,"elevators_rated_load":null,"cold_finished":null,"warnings":{"concrete_aggregate_size_max":["Not specified"],"concrete_max_slump":["Not specified"],"concrete_slump":["Not specified"],"concrete_w_c_ratio":["Not specified"],"pcr":["EPD issued after PCR expiry date.

(high slump) and sets with no compaction. It is often used in tight or restricted access areas where placing and compacting fill is difficult. Applications include filling large voids such as abandoned underground storage tanks, basements, tunnels, mines, and sewers. It can also be used as paving sub-base, bridge abutment, and retaining wall backfill. Also called Controlled Density Fill (CDF) or Controlled Low Strength Materials (CLSMs). These materials typically have compressive strengths under 1200 psi.","declared_unit":"1 m3","pct50_gwp":"123.1396058 kgCO2e","pct30_gwp":"91.39695183 kgCO2e"},"decking_board_material":null,"frame_material":null,"hurricane_resistant":null,"best_practice":"40.83470027 kgCO2e","uncertainty_adjusted_gwp":"49.36529973 kgCO2e","jacket_material":null,"galvanized":null,"outlet_level_switching":null,"gypsum_thickness":null,"is_downloadable":true,"intended_application":null,"aac_white":null,"concrete_flexion_strength":null,"fire_radiant_panel_rating_astme648":null,"c1157":null,"elevators_rated_load":null,"cold_finished":null,"warnings":{"concrete_aggregate_size_max":["Not specified"],"concrete_max_slump":["Not specified"],"concrete_slump":["Not specified"],"concrete_w_c_ratio":["Not specified"],"pcr":["EPD issued after PCR expiry date.

(high slump) and sets with no compaction. It is often used in tight or restricted access areas where placing and compacting fill is difficult. Applications include filling large voids such as abandoned underground storage tanks, basements, tunnels, mines, and sewers. It can also be used as paving sub-base, bridge abutment, and retaining wall backfill. Also called Controlled Density Fill (CDF) or Controlled Low Strength Materials (CLSMs). These materials typically have compressive strengths under 1200 psi.","declared_unit":"1 m3","pct50_gwp":"123.1396058 kgCO2e","pct30_gwp":"91.39695183 kgCO2e"},"decking_board_material":null,"frame_material":null,"hurricane_resistant":null,"best_practice":"54.79884195 kgCO2e","uncertainty_adjusted_gwp":"58.80115805 kgCO2e","jacket_material":null,"galvanized":null,"outlet_level_switching":null,"gypsum_thickness":null,"is_downloadable":true,"intended_application":null,"aac_white":null,"concrete_flexion_strength":null,"fire_radiant_panel_rating_astme648":null,"c1157":null,"elevators_rated_load":null,"cold_finished":null,"warnings":{"concrete_aggregate_size_max":["Not specified"],"concrete_max_slump":["Not specified"],"concrete_slump":["Not specified"],"concrete_w_c_ratio":["Not specified"],"pcr":["EPD issued after PCR expiry date.

(high slump) and sets with no compaction. It is often used in tight or restricted access areas where placing and compacting fill is difficult. Applications include filling large voids such as abandoned underground storage tanks, basements, tunnels, mines, and sewers. It can also be used as paving sub-base, bridge abutment, and retaining wall backfill. Also called Controlled Density Fill (CDF) or Controlled Low Strength Materials (CLSMs). These materials typically have compressive strengths under 1200 psi.","declared_unit":"1 m3","pct50_gwp":"123.1396058 kgCO2e","pct30_gwp":"91.39695183 kgCO2e"},"decking_board_material":null,"frame_material":null,"hurricane_resistant":null,"best_practice":"167.5267591 kgCO2e","uncertainty_adjusted_gwp":"188.4732409 kgCO2e","jacket_material":null,"galvanized":null,"outlet_level_switching":null,"gypsum_thickness":null,"is_downloadable":true,"intended_application":null,"aac_white":null,"concrete_flexion_strength":null,"fire_radiant_panel_rating_astme648":null,"c1157":null,"elevators_rated_load":null,"cold_finished":null,"warnings":{"concrete_aggregate_size_max":["Not specified"],"concrete_max_slump":["Not specified"],"concrete_slump":["Not specified"],"concrete_w_c_ratio":["Not specified"],"pcr":["EPD issued after PCR expiry date.

(high slump) and sets with no compaction. It is often used in tight or restricted access areas where placing and compacting fill is difficult. Applications include filling large voids such as abandoned underground storage tanks, basements, tunnels, mines, and sewers. It can also be used as paving sub-base, bridge abutment, and retaining wall backfill. Also called Controlled Density Fill (CDF) or Controlled Low Strength Materials (CLSMs). These materials typically have compressive strengths under 1200 psi.","declared_unit":"1 m3","pct50_gwp":"123.1396058 kgCO2e","pct30_gwp":"91.39695183 kgCO2e"},"decking_board_material":null,"frame_material":null,"hurricane_resistant":null,"best_practice":"125.854176 kgCO2e","uncertainty_adjusted_gwp":"152.145824 kgCO2e","jacket_material":null,"galvanized":null,"outlet_level_switching":null,"gypsum_thickness":null,"is_downloadable":true,"intended_application":null,"aac_white":null,"concrete_flexion_strength":null,"fire_radiant_panel_rating_astme648":null,"c1157":null,"elevators_rated_load":null,"cold_finished":null,"warnings":{"concrete_aggregate_size_max":["Not specified"],"concrete_max_slump":["Not specified"],"concrete_slump":["Not specified"],"concrete_w_c_ratio":["Not specified"],"pcr":["EPD issued after PCR expiry date.

(high slump) and sets with no compaction. It is often used in tight or restricted access areas where placing and compacting fill is difficult. Applications include filling large voids such as abandoned underground storage tanks, basements, tunnels, mines, and sewers. It can also be used as paving sub-base, bridge abutment, and retaining wall backfill. Also called Controlled Density Fill (CDF) or Controlled Low Strength Materials (CLSMs). These materials typically have compressive strengths under 1200 psi.","declared_unit":"1 m3","pct50_gwp":"123.1396058 kgCO2e","pct30_gwp":"91.39695183 kgCO2e"},"decking_board_material":null,"frame_material":null,"hurricane_resistant":null,"best_practice":"128.5704532 kgCO2e","uncertainty_adjusted_gwp":"155.4295468 kgCO2e","jacket_material":null,"galvanized":null,"outlet_level_switching":null,"gypsum_thickness":null,"is_downloadable":true,"intended_application":null,"aac_white":null,"concrete_flexion_strength":null,"fire_radiant_panel_rating_astme648":null,"c1157":null,"elevators_rated_load":null,"cold_finished":null,"warnings":{"concrete_aggregate_size_max":["Not specified"],"concrete_max_slump":["Not specified"],"concrete_slump":["Not specified"],"concrete_w_c_ratio":["Not specified"],"pcr":["EPD issued after PCR expiry date.

(high slump) and sets with no compaction. It is often used in tight or restricted access areas where placing and compacting fill is difficult. Applications include filling large voids such as abandoned underground storage tanks, basements, tunnels, mines, and sewers. It can also be used as paving sub-base, bridge abutment, and retaining wall backfill. Also called Controlled Density Fill (CDF) or Controlled Low Strength Materials (CLSMs). These materials typically have compressive strengths under 1200 psi.","declared_unit":"1 m3","pct50_gwp":"123.1396058 kgCO2e","pct30_gwp":"91.39695183 kgCO2e"},"decking_board_material":null,"frame_material":null,"hurricane_resistant":null,"best_practice":"124.9487503 kgCO2e","uncertainty_adjusted_gwp":"151.0512497 kgCO2e","jacket_material":null,"galvanized":null,"outlet_level_switching":null,"gypsum_thickness":null,"is_downloadable":true,"intended_application":null,"aac_white":null,"concrete_flexion_strength":null,"fire_radiant_panel_rating_astme648":null,"c1157":null,"elevators_rated_load":null,"cold_finished":null,"warnings":{"concrete_aggregate_size_max":["Not specified"],"concrete_max_slump":["Not specified"],"concrete_slump":["Not specified"],"concrete_w_c_ratio":["Not specified"],"pcr":["EPD issued after PCR expiry date.

(high slump) and sets with no compaction. It is often used in tight or restricted access areas where placing and compacting fill is difficult. Applications include filling large voids such as abandoned underground storage tanks, basements, tunnels, mines, and sewers. It can also be used as paving sub-base, bridge abutment, and retaining wall backfill. Also called Controlled Density Fill (CDF) or Controlled Low Strength Materials (CLSMs). These materials typically have compressive strengths under 1200 psi.","declared_unit":"1 m3","pct50_gwp":"123.1396058 kgCO2e","pct30_gwp":"91.39695183 kgCO2e"},"decking_board_material":null,"frame_material":null,"hurricane_resistant":null,"best_practice":"73.88273929 kgCO2e","uncertainty_adjusted_gwp":"89.31726071 kgCO2e","jacket_material":null,"galvanized":null,"outlet_level_switching":null,"gypsum_thickness":null,"is_downloadable":true,"intended_application":null,"aac_white":null,"concrete_flexion_strength":null,"fire_radiant_panel_rating_astme648":null,"c1157":null,"elevators_rated_load":null,"cold_finished":null,"warnings":{"concrete_aggregate_size_max":["Not specified"],"concrete_max_slump":["Not specified"],"concrete_slump":["Not specified"],"concrete_w_c_ratio":["Not specified"],"pcr":["EPD issued after PCR expiry date.

(high slump) and sets with no compaction. It is often used in tight or restricted access areas where placing and compacting fill is difficult. Applications include filling large voids such as abandoned underground storage tanks, basements, tunnels, mines, and sewers. It can also be used as paving sub-base, bridge abutment, and retaining wall backfill. Also called Controlled Density Fill (CDF) or Controlled Low Strength Materials (CLSMs). These materials typically have compressive strengths under 1200 psi.","declared_unit":"1 m3","pct50_gwp":"123.1396058 kgCO2e","pct30_gwp":"91.39695183 kgCO2e"},"decking_board_material":null,"frame_material":null,"hurricane_resistant":null,"best_practice":"124.9487503 kgCO2e","uncertainty_adjusted_gwp":"151.0512497 kgCO2e","jacket_material":null,"galvanized":null,"outlet_level_switching":null,"gypsum_thickness":null,"is_downloadable":true,"intended_application":null,"aac_white":null,"concrete_flexion_strength":null,"fire_radiant_panel_rating_astme648":null,"c1157":null,"elevators_rated_load":null,"cold_finished":null,"warnings":{"concrete_aggregate_size_max":["Not specified"],"concrete_max_slump":["Not specified"],"concrete_slump":["Not specified"],"concrete_w_c_ratio":["Not specified"],"pcr":["EPD issued after PCR expiry date.

(high slump) and sets with no compaction. It is often used in tight or restricted access areas where placing and compacting fill is difficult. Applications include filling large voids such as abandoned underground storage tanks, basements, tunnels, mines, and sewers. It can also be used as paving sub-base, bridge abutment, and retaining wall backfill. Also called Controlled Density Fill (CDF) or Controlled Low Strength Materials (CLSMs). These materials typically have compressive strengths under 1200 psi.","declared_unit":"1 m3","pct50_gwp":"123.1396058 kgCO2e","pct30_gwp":"91.39695183 kgCO2e"},"decking_board_material":null,"frame_material":null,"hurricane_resistant":null,"best_practice":"101.4076814 kgCO2e","uncertainty_adjusted_gwp":"122.5923186 kgCO2e","jacket_material":null,"galvanized":null,"outlet_level_switching":null,"gypsum_thickness":null,"is_downloadable":true,"intended_application":null,"aac_white":null,"concrete_flexion_strength":null,"fire_radiant_panel_rating_astme648":null,"c1157":null,"elevators_rated_load":null,"cold_finished":null,"warnings":{"concrete_aggregate_size_max":["Not specified"],"concrete_max_slump":["Not specified"],"concrete_slump":["Not specified"],"concrete_w_c_ratio":["Not specified"],"pcr":["EPD issued after PCR expiry date.

(high slump) and sets with no compaction. It is often used in tight or restricted access areas where placing and compacting fill is difficult. Applications include filling large voids such as abandoned underground storage tanks, basements, tunnels, mines, and sewers. It can also be used as paving sub-base, bridge abutment, and retaining wall backfill. Also called Controlled Density Fill (CDF) or Controlled Low Strength Materials (CLSMs). These materials typically have compressive strengths under 1200 psi.","declared_unit":"1 m3","pct50_gwp":"123.1396058 kgCO2e","pct30_gwp":"91.39695183 kgCO2e"},"decking_board_material":null,"frame_material":null,"hurricane_resistant":null,"best_practice":"157.5440764 kgCO2e","uncertainty_adjusted_gwp":"190.4559236 kgCO2e","jacket_material":null,"galvanized":null,"outlet_level_switching":null,"gypsum_thickness":null,"is_downloadable":true,"intended_application":null,"aac_white":null,"concrete_flexion_strength":null,"fire_radiant_panel_rating_astme648":null,"c1157":null,"elevators_rated_load":null,"cold_finished":null,"warnings":{"concrete_aggregate_size_max":["Not specified"],"concrete_max_slump":["Not specified"],"concrete_slump":["Not specified"],"concrete_w_c_ratio":["Not specified"],"pcr":["EPD issued after PCR expiry date.

(high slump) and sets with no compaction. It is often used in tight or restricted access areas where placing and compacting fill is difficult. Applications include filling large voids such as abandoned underground storage tanks, basements, tunnels, mines, and sewers. It can also be used as paving sub-base, bridge abutment, and retaining wall backfill. Also called Controlled Density Fill (CDF) or Controlled Low Strength Materials (CLSMs). These materials typically have compressive strengths under 1200 psi.","declared_unit":"1 m3","pct50_gwp":"123.1396058 kgCO2e","pct30_gwp":"91.39695183 kgCO2e"},"decking_board_material":null,"frame_material":null,"hurricane_resistant":null,"best_practice":"70.89483439 kgCO2e","uncertainty_adjusted_gwp":"85.70516561 kgCO2e","jacket_material":null,"galvanized":null,"outlet_level_switching":null,"gypsum_thickness":null,"is_downloadable":true,"intended_application":null,"aac_white":null,"concrete_flexion_strength":null,"fire_radiant_panel_rating_astme648":null,"c1157":null,"elevators_rated_load":null,"cold_finished":null,"warnings":{"concrete_aggregate_size_max":["Not specified"],"concrete_max_slump":["Not specified"],"concrete_slump":["Not specified"],"concrete_w_c_ratio":["Not specified"],"pcr":["EPD issued after PCR expiry date.

(high slump) and sets with no compaction. It is often used in tight or restricted access areas where placing and compacting fill is difficult. Applications include filling large voids such as abandoned underground storage tanks, basements, tunnels, mines, and sewers. It can also be used as paving sub-base, bridge abutment, and retaining wall backfill. Also called Controlled Density Fill (CDF) or Controlled Low Strength Materials (CLSMs).

(high slump) and sets with no compaction. It is often used in tight or restricted access areas where placing and compacting fill is difficult. Applications include filling large voids such as abandoned underground storage tanks, basements, tunnels, mines, and sewers. It can also be used as paving sub-base, bridge abutment, and retaining wall backfill. Also called Controlled Density Fill (CDF) or Controlled Low Strength Materials (CLSMs). These materials typically have compressive strengths under 1200 psi.","declared_unit":"1 m3","pct50_gwp":"123.1396058 kgCO2e","pct30_gwp":"91.39695183 kgCO2e"},"decking_board_material":null,"frame_material":null,"hurricane_resistant":null,"best_practice":"160.2603536 kgCO2e","uncertainty_adjusted_gwp":"193.7396464 kgCO2e","jacket_material":null,"galvanized":null,"outlet_level_switching":null,"gypsum_thickness":null,"is_downloadable":true,"intended_application":null,"aac_white":null,"concrete_flexion_strength":null,"fire_radiant_panel_rating_astme648":null,"c1157":null,"elevators_rated_load":null,"cold_finished":null,"warnings":{"concrete_aggregate_size_max":["Not specified"],"concrete_max_slump":["Not specified"],"concrete_slump":["Not specified"],"concrete_w_c_ratio":["Not specified"],"pcr":["EPD issued after PCR expiry date.

(high slump) and sets with no compaction. It is often used in tight or restricted access areas where placing and compacting fill is difficult. Applications include filling large voids such as abandoned underground storage tanks, basements, tunnels, mines, and sewers. It can also be used as paving sub-base, bridge abutment, and retaining wall backfill. Also called Controlled Density Fill (CDF) or Controlled Low Strength Materials (CLSMs). These materials typically have compressive strengths under 1200 psi.","declared_unit":"1 m3","pct50_gwp":"123.1396058 kgCO2e","pct30_gwp":"91.39695183 kgCO2e"},"decking_board_material":null,"frame_material":null,"hurricane_resistant":null,"best_practice":"80.94505996 kgCO2e","uncertainty_adjusted_gwp":"97.85494004 kgCO2e","jacket_material":null,"galvanized":null,"outlet_level_switching":null,"gypsum_thickness":null,"is_downloadable":true,"intended_application":null,"aac_white":null,"concrete_flexion_strength":null,"fire_radiant_panel_rating_astme648":null,"c1157":null,"elevators_rated_load":null,"cold_finished":null,"warnings":{"concrete_aggregate_size_max":["Not specified"],"concrete_max_slump":["Not specified"],"concrete_slump":["Not specified"],"concrete_w_c_ratio":["Not specified"],"pcr":["EPD issued after PCR expiry date.

(high slump) and sets with no compaction. It is often used in tight or restricted access areas where placing and compacting fill is difficult. Applications include filling large voids such as abandoned underground storage tanks, basements, tunnels, mines, and sewers. It can also be used as paving sub-base, bridge abutment, and retaining wall backfill. Also called Controlled Density Fill (CDF) or Controlled Low Strength Materials (CLSMs). These materials typically have compressive strengths under 1200 psi.","declared_unit":"1 m3","pct50_gwp":"123.1396058 kgCO2e","pct30_gwp":"91.39695183

(high slump) and sets with no compaction. It is often used in tight or restricted access areas where placing and compacting fill is difficult. Applications include filling large voids such as abandoned underground storage tanks, basements, tunnels, mines, and sewers. It can also be used as paving sub-base, bridge abutment, and retaining wall backfill. Also called Controlled Density Fill (CDF) or Controlled Low Strength Materials (CLSMs). These materials typically have compressive strengths under 1200 psi.","declared_unit":"1 m3","pct50_gwp":"123.1396058 kgCO2e","pct30_gwp":"91.39695183 kgCO2e"},"decking_board_material":null,"frame_material":null,"hurricane_resistant":null,"best_practice":"76.05576103 kgCO2e","uncertainty_adjusted_gwp":"91.94423897 kgCO2e","jacket_material":null,"galvanized":null,"outlet_level_switching":null,"gypsum_thickness":null,"is_downloadable":true,"intended_application":null,"aac_white":null,"concrete_flexion_strength":null,"fire_radiant_panel_rating_astme648":null,"c1157":null,"elevators_rated_load":null,"cold_finished":null,"warnings":{"concrete_aggregate_size_max":["Not specified"],"concrete_max_slump":["Not specified"],"concrete_slump":["Not specified"],"concrete_w_c_ratio":["Not specified"],"pcr":["EPD issued after PCR expiry date.

It can also be used as paving sub-base, bridge abutment, and retaining wall backfill. Also called Controlled Density Fill (CDF) or Controlled Low Strength Materials (CLSMs).

(high slump) and sets with no compaction. It is often used in tight or restricted access areas where placing and compacting fill is difficult. Applications include filling large voids such as abandoned underground storage tanks, basements, tunnels, mines, and sewers. It can also be used as paving sub-base, bridge abutment, and retaining wall backfill. Also called Controlled Density Fill (CDF) or Controlled Low Strength Materials (CLSMs). These materials typically have compressive strengths under 1200 psi.","declared_unit":"1 m3","pct50_gwp":"123.1396058 kgCO2e","pct30_gwp":"91.39695183 kgCO2e"},"decking_board_material":null,"frame_material":null,"hurricane_resistant":null,"best_practice":"95.06970129 kgCO2e","uncertainty_adjusted_gwp":"114.9302987 kgCO2e","jacket_material":null,"galvanized":null,"outlet_level_switching":null,"gypsum_thickness":null,"is_downloadable":true,"intended_application":null,"aac_white":null,"concrete_flexion_strength":null,"fire_radiant_panel_rating_astme648":null,"c1157":null,"elevators_rated_load":null,"cold_finished":null,"warnings":{"concrete_aggregate_size_max":["Not specified"],"concrete_max_slump":["Not specified"],"concrete_slump":["Not specified"],"concrete_w_c_ratio":["Not specified"],"pcr":["EPD issued after PCR expiry date.

(high slump) and sets with no compaction. It is often used in tight or restricted access areas where placing and compacting fill is difficult. Applications include filling large voids such as abandoned underground storage tanks, basements, tunnels, mines, and sewers. It can also be used as paving sub-base, bridge abutment, and retaining wall backfill. Also called Controlled Density Fill (CDF) or Controlled Low Strength Materials (CLSMs). These materials typically have compressive strengths under 1200 psi.","declared_unit":"1 m3","pct50_gwp":"123.1396058 kgCO2e","pct30_gwp":"91.39695183 kgCO2e"},"decking_board_material":null,"frame_material":null,"hurricane_resistant":null,"best_practice":"65.5528226 kgCO2e","uncertainty_adjusted_gwp":"79.2471774 kgCO2e","jacket_material":null,"galvanized":null,"outlet_level_switching":null,"gypsum_thickness":null,"is_downloadable":true,"intended_application":null,"aac_white":null,"concrete_flexion_strength":null,"fire_radiant_panel_rating_astme648":null,"c1157":null,"elevators_rated_load":null,"cold_finished":null,"warnings":{"concrete_aggregate_size_max":["Not specified"],"concrete_max_slump":["Not specified"],"concrete_slump":["Not specified"],"concrete_w_c_ratio":["Not specified"],"pcr":["EPD issued after PCR expiry date.
