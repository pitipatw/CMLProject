The unique design of ELEVATIONS and ELEVATIONS LOFT allows the planks and tiles to be installed over all types of subfloors including natural wood, concrete, one layer of existing vinyl, ceramic and uneven subfloors. The flooring is water resistant so that it can be installed in moisture prone areas where wood flooring and laminate products would not be used. The manufacturing process and physical construction of the ELEVATIONS and ELEVATIONS LOFT lines are identical. ELEVATIONS is a 5 mm product with a 12 or 20 mil wear layer.

OF MAIN MATERIALS:\n\nCalcium Carbonate: An abundant mineral found worldwide and a common substance found in rocks. It can be ground into varying particle sizes and used as inert filler.\n\nGlass Paper (Fiber): Nonwoven glass scrim comprised of chopped glass and cellulose fibers and binder.  Its major ingredients are silica sand, limestone, soda ash, and petrochemicals.\n\nPolyvinyl Chloride (PVC): Derived from fossil fuel and salt. Petroleum or natural gas is processed to make ethylene, and salt is subjected to electrolysis to separate out the natural element chlorine. Ethylene and chlorine are combined to produce ethylene dichloride, which is further processed into a gas called vinyl chloride monomer (VCM). Polymerization of VCM molecules form chains, converting the gas into fine, white powder—vinyl resin. \n\nPlasticizer: Plasticizers are used to make vinyl soft and flexible. Diisononyl phthalate (DINP) was used in the life cycle assessment model to represent plasticizers used to manufacture products covered by this EPD such as Diisooctyl terephthalate (DOTP).\n\nStabilizers: Stabilizers (typically metal compounds) are used to prevent the chain reaction of decomposition which occurs as PVC is heated to soften during the extrusion or molding process. Stabilizers also provide enhanced resistance to daylight, weathering and heat aging and have an important influence on the physical properties of PVC. The main constituents are metal soaps, metal salts and organometallic compounds. The major metals contained in stabilizers include lead (Pb), barium (Ba), calcium (Ca), and tin (Sn) and are classified into Pb stabilizers, Ba-Znstabilizers, Ca-Zn stabilizers, and Sn stabilizersPigment: A compounded mixture of pigment (e.g., carbon black, titanium dioxide) and a polymer carrier used as a colorant.\n\nUV Resin (coating): A UV coating composed of photo-curable oligomer, photo initiator, reactive acrylic monomer and additives.","assembly_u_factor":null,"access_flooring_magnetically_attached_finish":null,"fire_smoke_density_rating_astme648":null,"access_flooring_stringers":null,"biogenic_embodied_carbon":null,"asphalt_ppa":null,"elevators_rated_speed":null,"steel_modulus_of_elasticity":null,"industry_standards":["See

OF MAIN MATERIALS:\n\nCalcium Carbonate: An abundant mineral found worldwide and a common substance found in rocks. It can be ground into varying particle sizes and used as an inert filler.\n\nGlass Paper (Fiber): Nonwoven glass scrim comprised of chopped glass and cellulose fibers and binder.  Its major ingredients are silica sand, limestone, soda ash, and petrochemicals.\n\nPolyvinyl Chloride (PVC): Derived from fossil fuel and salt. Petroleum or natural gas is processed to make ethylene, and salt is subjected to electrolysis to separate out the natural element chlorine. Ethylene and chlorine are combined to produce ethylene dichloride, which is further processed into a gas called vinyl chloride monomer (VCM). Polymerization of VCM molecules form chains, converting the gas into fine, white powder—vinyl resin. \n\nPlasticizer: Plasticizers are used to make vinyl soft and flexible. Diisononyl phthalate (DINP) wasused in the life cycle assessment model to represent plasticizers used to manufacture products covered by this EPD such as Diisooctyl terephthalate (DOTP).\n\nStabilizers: Stabilizers (typically metal compounds) are used to prevent the chain reaction of decomposition which occurs as PVC is heated to soften during the extrusion or molding process. Stabilizers also provide enhanced resistance to daylight, weathering and heat aging and have an important influence on the physical properties of PVC. The main constituents are metal soaps, metal salts and organometallic compounds. The major metals contained in stabilizers include lead (Pb), barium (Ba), calcium (Ca), and tin (Sn) and are classified into Pb stabilizers, Ba-Zn stabilizers, Ca-Zn stabilizers, and Sn stabilizers.\n\nPigment: A compounded mixture of pigment (e.g., carbon black, titanium dioxide) and a polymer carrier used as a colorant.\n\nUV Resin (coating): A UV coating composed of photo-curable oligomer, photo initiator, reactive acrylic monomer and additives.","assembly_u_factor":null,"access_flooring_magnetically_attached_finish":null,"fire_smoke_density_rating_astme648":null,"access_flooring_stringers":null,"biogenic_embodied_carbon":null,"asphalt_ppa":null,"elevators_rated_speed":null,"steel_modulus_of_elasticity":null,"industry_standards":["See

Classification and Description Milliken LVT is highly durable and resilient flooring made with over 50% calcium carbonate (aka limestone, a globally abundant resource), virgin PVC resin and alternative bio-based plasticizer. At the time of this EPD’s publication, Milliken has replaced DINP. Milliken LVT is constructed with multiple layers as illustrated in the following diagram. All the layers are fused together into a flooring slab in a hot press. Each floor slab is then annealed and acclimated to release any built-in stress within the product. Finally each floor slab are punched and finished into floor panels of different sizes, then packaged into cartons for shipment. All production waste are granulated and put back into backing production to create an internal closed loop recycling process.

OF MAIN MATERIALS:\n\nCalcium Carbonate: An abundant mineral found worldwide and a common substance found in rocks. It can be ground into varying particle sizes and used as inert filler.\n\nGlass Paper (Fiber): Nonwoven glass scrim comprised of chopped glass and cellulose fibers and binder.  Its major ingredients are silica sand, limestone, soda ash, and petrochemicals.\n\nPolyvinyl Chloride (PVC): Derived from fossil fuel and salt. Petroleum or natural gas is processed to make ethylene, and salt is subjected to electrolysis to separate out the natural element chlorine. Ethylene and chlorine are combined to produce ethylene dichloride, which is further processed into a gas called vinyl chloride monomer (VCM). Polymerization of VCM molecules form chains, converting the gas into fine, white powder—vinyl resin. \n\nPlasticizer: Plasticizers are used to make vinyl soft and flexible. Diisononyl phthalate (DINP) was used in the life cycle assessment model to represent plasticizers used to manufacture products covered by this EPD such as Diisooctyl terephthalate (DOTP).\n\nStabilizers: Stabilizers (typically metal compounds) are used to prevent the chain reaction of decomposition which occurs as PVC is heated to soften during the extrusion or molding process. Stabilizers also provide enhanced resistance to daylight, weathering and heat aging and have an important influence on the physical properties of PVC. The main constituents are metal soaps, metal salts and organometallic compounds. The major metals contained in stabilizers include lead (Pb), barium (Ba), calcium (Ca), and tin (Sn) and are classified into Pb stabilizers, Ba-Znstabilizers, Ca-Zn stabilizers, and Sn stabilizers.\n\nPigment: A compounded mixture of pigment (e.g., carbon black, titanium dioxide) and a polymer carrier used as a colorant.\n\nUV Resin (coating): A UV coating composed of photo-curable oligomer, photo initiator, reactive acrylic monomer and additives.","assembly_u_factor":null,"access_flooring_magnetically_attached_finish":null,"fire_smoke_density_rating_astme648":null,"access_flooring_stringers":null,"biogenic_embodied_carbon":null,"asphalt_ppa":null,"elevators_rated_speed":null,"steel_modulus_of_elasticity":null,"industry_standards":["Table

Luxury Vinyl Tile Representative Product covers a range of styles and colors. The actual volume of each product selling in the USA was used proportionately to determine the overall average value of the characteristics of the representative product. Vinyl tile is made primarily from calcium carbonate (limestone), polyvinyl chloride, plasticizers and additives (i.e., pigments and stabilizers). It is structured with five layers: two PVC backing layers, one high definition photographic layer, one clear PVC embossed wear layer and a top PU protective layer. Post-industrial scrap materials are recycled back into the luxury vinyl tile during production. Luxury Vinyl Tile is used in both commercial and residential interiors. It is commonly available in 2.0 mm, 2.5 mm, 3.0 mm, 4.5 mm and 5.0 mm thicknesses. The average weight of this representative product is 5,510 g/m². The manufacturing process produces a product with a multiple layer construction. A decorative film and PVC transparent wear layer are applied as the surface layers with a lacquer used as a protective finish on the wear layer. The products included in this EPD are Art Select, Da Vinci, Van Gogh, Opus, Knight Tile, Michelangelo, HDC, K-Trade in tile or plank formats. © 2015 SCSglobalServices.com 3 Environmental Product
