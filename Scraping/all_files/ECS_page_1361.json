offers a range of highly effective products to seal, prime and undercoat surfaces in preparation for Dulux® high performance top coat products.The preparation paints declared in this EPD are:Dulux® Acrylic Sealer Undercoat: A low VOC (5g/L) acrylic sealer undercoat with excellent hiding power and filling properties for use on interior plasterboard and textured surfaces.Dulux® Professional® Total Prep: A high quality all-in-one acrylic primer/sealer/undercoat. Suitable for use on almost all interior and exterior surfaces.Dulux has produced three EPDs: preparation paints (primers, sealers and undercoats), broad-wall paints and ceiling paints. All EPDs declare the impacts of 1 m2 of painted surface, assuming the recommended number of coats and typical coverage rates.To calculate the impacts of a paint system, locate the results tables for both your prep coat and top coat and then add together the numbers (i.e. preparation + topcoat) for each module separately (A1-A3, A4, A5,

Wear® is Dulux's leading paint for washability performance. It forms a velvety finish that is hard-wearing and easy to keep clean. It gives walls the ultimate protection to stay looking freshly painted for years, reducing the need to repaint as frequently.The Wash Wear® +Plus range delivers even better performance for specific project needs. For example, Wash Wear® +Plus Super Tough is a two-pack water-based epoxy paint that provides ultimate abrasion resistance to walls that need extra protection. Dulux® Wash Wear® +Plus Super Tough can be repeatedly scrubbed so it will stay looking freshly painted for years.The SteriGuard® range delivers protection and durability to coated surfaces which withstand the harsh chemical cleaning regimes of any clinical environment. The SteriGuard® range of low-sheen and ultra-protection broad-wall options as well as a water-based enamel offer long-lasting protection.Dulux has produced three EPDs: preparation paints (primers, sealers and undercoats), broad-wall paints and ceiling paints.

The product is then packaged for distribution to the customer. Process flow diagram Construction Installation All surfaces should be sound, clean, dry and free from grease. Remove any crazed or flaking paint. Stir well before use and apply by brush, roller or paint pad. When using a roller, use a medium pile synthetic type. Apply liberally and evenly; avoid overspreading. Do not apply when air or surface temperature is less than 5°C or in damp conditions. Use Information No activities are required during the use phase End of Life Coatings are often not removed, so the end of life the product is that of the end of life of the underlying substrate. For interior wall paint on a mineral surface this is often landfill.

Acrylic Durable Matt is an emulsion formulated for interior use on walls and ceilings. In addition it can be used on suitably primed woodwork and radiators. This low odour paint is washable and wipeable, providing a tough finish that is resistant to condensation, yellowing and most household stains. Johnstone’s Acrylic Durable Matt is based on acrylic dispersion technology.

The product is then packaged for distribution to the customer. Process flow diagram Construction Installation All surfaces should be sound, clean, dry and free from grease. Remove any crazed or flaking paint. Stir well before use and apply by brush, roller or paint pad. When using a roller, use a medium pile synthetic type. Apply liberally and evenly; avoid overspreading. Do not apply when air or surface temperature is less than 10°C or in damp conditions. If more than one can of colour is to be used in the same area, intermix before use. Reference Service Life The reference service life of the product is highly dependent on the conditions of use. End of Life Coatings are often not removed, so the end of life the product is that of the end of life of the underlying substrate. For interior wall paint on a mineral surface this is often landfill.

Remove any crazed or flaking paint. Stir well before use and apply by brush, roller or paint pad. When using a roller, use a medium pile synthetic type. Apply liberally and evenly; avoid overspreading. Do not apply when air or surface temperature is less than 10°C or in damp conditions. If more than one can of colour is to be used in the same area, intermix before use. Reference Service Life The reference service life of the product is highly dependent on the conditions of use. End of Life Coatings are often not removed, so the end of life the product is that of the end of life of the underlying substrate. For interior wall paint on a mineral surface this is often landfill.

HYPOALLERGENIC BREATHABLE WATER-BASED PAINT FOR INTERIORS It realizes finishes with matt outward, with particular porosity that ensures an excellent water vapor permeability and a low dirt retention. ARUM has a low content of volatile compounds and is free of formaldehyde and plasticizers added, resulting specific for painting indoors. Its formulation gives it particular features such as ease of application, excellent coverage and a high whiteness. The high opacity makes it suitable for application on surfaces with different absorption. ARUM, differently from traditional paints based on aqueous dispersion, does not require long aeration before re-inhabiting the

KILZ® ADHESION Primer is a water-based primer specifically formulated to bond to a variety of “tough to paint” surfaces. Its advanced chemistry provides a sound anchor for topcoats while reducing or potentially eliminating the need for sanding dense and glossy surfaces. This primer can be used on interior and exterior surfaces and can be topcoated with latex paint, oil-based paint, epoxy, shellac, or lacquer. KILZ ADHESION is available in quart and 1-gallon containers and is tintable for dramatic color changes. Product Components Related to Life Cycle Assessment The material composition of the paints are in the following range: Table 1: Material composition range in % by mass for the KILZ® ADHESION Primer Mass Composition [%] Acrylic resin 40 - 45 Additive 1-3 Clay 0-1 Nepheline syenite 15 - 20 pH buffer 0-1 Preservative 0-1 Rheology modifier 1-3 Solvent 1-3 Talc 3-5 Titanium dioxide 15 - 20 Water 15 - 20 The functional unit for the study was covering and protecting 1m2 of substrate for a period of 60 years (the assumed lifetime of a building), exhibiting 97% opacity after drying. The functional unit and reference flow required for the functional unit were calculated for the market life prescribed by the PCR. Market life is 5 years for interior paints and 10 years for exterior paints. The design life is not applicable to the category Primer, Sealers, and Undercoaters. Market life reference flow and colorant quantity are shown in Table 2. Results were calculated for all base and sheen formulations.

Environmental Product Declaration covers the entire range of waterproofing with SBS sheets manufactured by DANOSA. \nThe waterproofing solutions with single-layer or double-layer bituminous membrane that DANOSA proposes are made up of the range of bitumen asphalt sheets modified with SBS-type elastomeric polymers.\nThese sheets are manufactured by calendering and are reinforced with a polyester fiber, reinforced polyester or fiberglass armor. The sheets for the lower layer are plasticized and for the upper layer they can be plasticized or have a mineral self-protection with slate.\nDuring installation, the sheets will form the bituminous membrane that will give rise to the flat roof waterproofing.\nThe function of waterproofing systems is mainly to protect the building against water in its various forms: rain, humidity, snow and hail.\nIn addition, depending on the system, the solution makes it possible to ensure thermal insulation over time, make the roof accessible to pedestrians and/or vehicles and/or enable the use of vegetation systems on the roof. These complementary functions, which are provided by insulation and finishing, have not been considered, nor has the use of materials that provide said function.","open_xpd_uuid":"ec334ck8","resilient_flooring_thickness":null,"masonry_cement_astm_c91_type":null,"cmu_glass_powder_containing":null,"steel_rebar_diameter_min":null,"density":null,"access_flooring_finish_material":null,"concrete_compressive_strength_other_d":null,"wall_base_material":null,"gwp":"3.64 kgCO2e","vrt":null,"sku":null,"asphalt_min_temperature":null,"fnd":null,"cable_trays_material":null,"pdu_outlets":null,"nsf347":false,"sog":null,"recommended_application":null,"cladding_r_value":null,"ceiling_panel_nrc":null,"plc":null,"asphalt_aggregate_size_max":null,"toughened":null,"concrete_co2_entrain":null,"thickness":null,"abuse_resistant":null,"steel_bar_elongation":null,"asphalt_gtr":null,"floor_box_cover":null,"cladding_insulating_material":null,"name":"Waterproofing with Bituminous Membrane - EXT1/NTV2","height":null,"cmu_weight_classification":null,"manufacturing_image":null,"energy_source":null,"flat_glass_panes_thickness":null,"cmu_smoothface":null,"residential_only":null,"wall_tile":null,"is_failed":false,"large_format":null,"product_usage_image_crop_area":null,"access_flooring_adjustable_height":null,"electrochromic":null,"mosaic_tile":null,"access_flooring_rolling_load_10_pass":null,"steel_composition":null,"manufacturer":{"horizontal_logo":null,"parent":null,"postal_code":"19290","primary_activity_operator":false,"email_extensions":null,"gwp_contact":null,"latitude":40.7267596,"primary_activity_digitization_qa":false,"longitude":-3.1767108,"my_capabilities":null,"pilot_all_employees":false,"primary_activity_design":false,"iso9001_certified":null,"primary_activity_performance_standards_issuer":false,"iso14001_certified":null,"web_domain":"danosa.com","cqd_sync_server_from":null,"primary_activity_verifier":false,"address":"19290 Fontanar, Guadalajara, Spain","name":"Derivados Asfálticos Normalizados S.A.

The special spinning process makes it possible to give the\nproduct excellent levels of resistance and stability.\nThe version Texbond® R, manufactured entirely in the production site in Novedrate (CO), is always a\nstaple polyester nonwoven, reinforced with glass filaments in machine direction.\nThe combination of the flexibility of polyester with the stability of glass not only allows excellent\nrunnability of the nonwoven, especially at high temperatures and when used on high-speed bitumen\nlines, but also gives the bituminous membrane outstanding dimensional stability and resistance over\ntime.\nUsing glass reinforcement also eliminates the phenomenon of thermal memory: once applied to roofs,\nthe membrane is not subject to shrinkage due to temperature changes.\nThe final application of Texbond® is the bituminous membrane, obtained from the process of bitumen\nimpregnation of the nonwoven at the production sites of membrane manufacturers and then used for\nthe waterproofing of roofs. For the LCA study of the finished product reference has to be made to any\nanalysis carried out by bituminous membranes manufacturers.\nNonwovens of the Texbond® family are available in numerous

and Base is a two-layer waterproofing system from Icopal, made for roofs with particularly high\ndemands on the waterproofing layer. The system consists of an upper layer (Top) and a lower layer\n(Base), both based on SBS-modified bitumen. SBS increases the elasticity of the waterproofing layer\nand provides increased joint strength and service life. Two separate waterproofing layers provide a\ngood protection against leakage. The lower layer can also be used as a temporary seal while the rest\nof the roof is completed. Waterproofing system Top & Base is available in two versions; SV and K/KL,\nwhere SV stands for weldable and K/KL for glued (with hot asphalt) when installed. The seven\nproducts included in this LCA can be installed in the following combinations to form a two-layer\nwaterproofing system: Base SV + Top SV, Base + Top, Base KL + Top KL, Base K + Top KL, Base\nSV + Base SV, Base K + Base K and Base KL + Base KL. Base SV and Base, Top and Top SV and\nBase K and Base KL are identical products but sold on different

is a product specific EPD for Isola Mestertekk. Mestertekk is a one layer roofing sheet for sloping and flat roofs, new built and rehabilitation. The product is made of natural bitumen free of tar, combined with thermoplastic elastomer, natural filler and granulate for UV protection and micrometer-thin foil. Raw materials are mixed separately at a specific range of temperature and successively reinforced with polyester fleece or glass fiber by impregnation. After calendaring and cooling, the roofing sheet is finished with light weight plastic films or slate granules. This is a dual registered EPD from the system by the Norwegian EPD Foundation, which has the right to bear both logotypes under the mutual recognition agreement between the two programmes.","open_xpd_uuid":"ec3fuzfs","resilient_flooring_thickness":null,"masonry_cement_astm_c91_type":null,"cmu_glass_powder_containing":null,"steel_rebar_diameter_min":null,"density":null,"access_flooring_finish_material":null,"concrete_compressive_strength_other_d":null,"wall_base_material":null,"gwp":"2.62
