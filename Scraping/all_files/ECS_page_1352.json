Having an EPD enables sustainable decision-making that can be backed up by credible data. Our mission is to undertake all operations in a responsible sustainable manner to achieve moral and community expectations. Providing environmentally sound erosion control, dust management and revegetation solutions for mines, civil construction, residential development and commercial infrastructure projects, this range of purpose-made products are unequalled in their suitability, durability, sustainability, and functionality. These products are manufactured in Australia, where Vital Chemical is uniquely positioned to formulate, manufacture, store, and rapidly distribute largescale volumes of our products to supply major projects throughout Australasia. Vital Bon-Matt Stonewall (IGD) stabilises dust emitting, erodible and exposed surfaces though its strong binding and flexible properties and is environmentally sound in formulation and effectiveness. Vital Bon-Matt P47-VR1 is effective for all erosion and dust control and may also be combined with revegetation products for effective mulch binding. Vital Bon-Matt HR is a heavy duty, robust and concentrated formulation for the heaviest trafficked, unsealed road surface applications and other more challenging stabilisation scenarios. VE Gro-Matt is a 100% Australian made bonded wood fibre matrix product, specifically designed for all revegetation, rehabilitation, erosion control, nutrient soil repair and soil amelioration projects.","open_xpd_uuid":"ec30cuh1","resilient_flooring_thickness":null,"masonry_cement_astm_c91_type":null,"cmu_glass_powder_containing":null,"steel_rebar_diameter_min":null,"density":null,"access_flooring_finish_material":null,"concrete_compressive_strength_other_d":null,"wall_base_material":null,"gwp":"0.703

Remove any crazed or flaking paint. Stir well before use and apply by brush, roller or paint pad. When using a roller, use a medium pile synthetic type. Apply liberally and evenly; avoid overspreading. Do not apply when air or surface temperature is less than 10°C or in damp conditions. If more than one can of colour is to be used in the same area, intermix before use. Reference Service Life The reference service life of the product is highly dependent on the conditions of use. End of Life Coatings are often not removed, so the end of life the product is that of the end of life of the underlying substrate. For interior wall paint on a mineral surface this is often landfill.

Trade Diamond Eggshell is a tough, durable and attractive mid-sheen finish. By using Diamond Technology from Dulux Trade it is 10 times tougher than Dulux Trade Vinyl Silk. Also includes Stain Repellent Technology so can be repeatedly wiped clean, making it ideal for high traffic areas such as stairwells and hallways. It is quick-drying and of low odour compared to solvent-based paints, and therefore ideal for use where minimum disruption is important. Dulux Trade Diamond Eggshell can be used over surfaces previously decorated with solvent-based paints, providing proper surface preparation is carried out. Dulux Trade Diamond Eggshell Light & Space uses revolutionary Lumitec technology that helps reflect up to twice1 as much light around the room, making even the smallest rooms look and feel more spacious compared to our conventional emulsion paints with a similar hue (colour family) and chroma (intensity of colour).

is a series of thermosetting powder coatings, based on polyester resins specifically selected for their excellent resistance to atmospheric ageing and UV\nradiation. These characteristics, combined with high mechanical properties, result in high performance coating films with very good outdoor durability and\nexcellent decorative properties. PP101 is designed for architectural use, on aluminum and galvanized steel. It is recommended for architectural aluminum profiles,\npanels, railings, outdoor machinery and equipment, automotive parts etc. All PP101 products are heavy metal and TGIC free.
