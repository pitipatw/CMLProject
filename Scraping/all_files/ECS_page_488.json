is prepared by mixingcement, coarse and fine aggregates, and water, with or without the addition of auxiliary agents and additives. The fresh concrete is placed on the building site or prefabricated in factory moulds, compacted and hardened in the desired shape by the hydration of cement to form concrete.General Australian Standard AS 1379 sets down a number of different ways of specifying and ordering concrete to promote uniformity, efficiency and economy in production and delivery. It refers to two classes of concrete: normal-class and special-class.","open_xpd_uuid":"ec3h8wyk","resilient_flooring_thickness":null,"masonry_cement_astm_c91_type":null,"cmu_glass_powder_containing":null,"steel_rebar_diameter_min":null,"density":"2400 kg
