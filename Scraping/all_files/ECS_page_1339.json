classification and description Products covered in this Environmental Product Declaration (EPD) are a broad variety of modular carpets manufactured by Avant Contract backed by thermoplastic backing and made with a type 6,6 nylon. The thermoplastic is comprised of a polyvinyl chloride comprised of at least 30% recycled content with a minimum of 11% post-consumer. The face fiber is 100% nylon 6,6 and is either solution, skein dyed, space dyed, piece dyed, or a combination of the methods. The products are covered by Avant Contract's Lifetime Limited Commercial Warranty. The products all pass the Carpet & Rugs Institute's (CRI) Green Label. The average weight of the backing system is 105 oz. per square yard. The variation in weight in the modular products is due to the amount of yarn weight. The weighted average used in the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) is 22 oz. per square yard, with the minimum yarn weight of 16 oz per square yard, and the maximum yarn weight

The variation between products is yarn weight. The yarn weight ranges from a low of 441 grams /square meter to a high of 1017 grams/square meter. The impact data will be presented for the low, medium, and high yarn weight products (441, 712, and 949 grams/sq meter), unless otherwise noted. Figure 17 displays the results for products of additional yarn weights. Discarded carpet is reclaimed through Interface’s ReEntry® 2.0 program where it is separated into fiber and backing. The reclaimed fiber is sent to yarn manufacturers where it is melted into Nylon granulate, combined with post industrial and virgin granulate, then extruded into new carpet yarn. The reclaimed backing is reprocessed and used as one of the feedstocks for GlasBac®RE, a recycled polyvinyl chloride (vinyl) backing. The recycling of post consumer carpet yarn and backing into new carpet represents a major accomplishment on the path to sustainable carpet construction. Figure 1.

Steel grade range for construction include low alloy structural steels, as-rolled, normalized and thermomechanically rolled, including weathering steels. Mean thickness value is at 20 mm but the declaration covers the whole range from 5 mm up to 100 mm. Width range is from 1400 mm up to 3300 mm. Weathering steels offer improved resistance to corrosion thanks to the addition of copper during manufacture. Additional alloying elements can be added to increase the steel’s tensile strength or make forming processes easier. Technical data: ArcelorMittal offers a full range of grades in compliance with the EN 10025-1 and EN 10025 - part 2 to 5 to meet different applications. ArcelorMittal has also created different grades of weathering steels to meet different applications. Their chemical composition and mechanical performance are specified in EN 10025-5. Yield strengths from 235 MPa up to 460 MPa are available. ArcelorMittal Europe Flat products is producing heavy plates in one mill located in Gijon in Spain.

The single operation production process occurs in ArcelorMittal Vega which can produce coated coils in thickness varying from 0.40 to 2.3mm and several widths depending on the steel grade. The coating process can apply various thickness of the zinc layer, up to 450 g/m² (total of both sides). Specific mechanical properties are defined for each steel grade used as substrate. The product is manufactured through the blast furnace-basic oxygen furnace (BF-BOF) route. Coke and iron ore (normally sinter produced from iron ore and limestone) are both fed into the blast furnace from the top; simultaneously, hot air and pulverised coal or natural gas (hydrogen is experimentally being used) are injected through pipes in the side of the lower part of the furnace called tuyeres. This results in a counter-cyclical process of descending iron ore met by rising reducing gases. Lime fluxes and other additives are also used in the blast furnace in varying quantities to control the level of impurities and the temperature. The blast furnace produces molten iron (“hot metal”) at temperatures up to 1400-1 500°C. The hot metal is then fed to the BOF, often in conjunction with some scrap, where oxygen is injected to lower the carbon content from approximately 4-5% to the required level of carbon for the steel grade produced. The produced liquid steel is then refined in a ladle furnace with addition of ferroalloys and metals to obtain the required steel characteristics. The steel is then casted at a continuous caster to obtain semi-finished products such as billets, blooms or slabs. The following operations are two rolling processes: the hot strip mill and the cold rolling mill. In the hot rolling mill the slab is reshaped above the recrystallization temperature.

Steel sheet piling are rolled steel profiles with longitudinal clutches at each side. Sheet piles can be connected to each other through these clutches creating a mechanical connection (i.e. interlock) between the profiles allowing the construction of a continuous wall. The product is manufactured by through the secondary route, in which different steel scraps are melted in an electric arc furnace to obtain liquid steel. This steel is then refined in a ladle furnace with addition of ferroalloys and metals to obtain the required steel characteristics. The steel is then casted at a continuous caster to obtain semi-finished products as billet or blooms. These products are then rolled to the desired size. Technical data: This EPD is valid for EcoSheetPiles™ steel piling products of varied grades and geometries, as well as different forms of delivery. Specific information on dimension tolerances, constructional data and mechanical and chemical properties can be found in the relevant standards /EN 10248/.

It is ideal for use in building slabs in all types of buildings as steel roofing deck. Steel manufactured by Ternium in its Guerrero Industrial Works for Ternium Losacero production uses 70% iron ore (direct reduced iron) and 30% steel scrap as source of iron. Ternium Losacero has three main functions: 1) To act as a work platform during construction, that is, it serves as a formwork for the casting, 2) To provide positive reinforcement by bending to the concrete slab and 3) To provide resistance for horizontal loads. Ternium Mexico manufactures several types of Ternium Losacero, the difference between the types of Ternium Losacero lies in the size of the cant, which provides specific characteristics during installation.","open_xpd_uuid":"ec3421fx","resilient_flooring_thickness":null,"masonry_cement_astm_c91_type":null,"cmu_glass_powder_containing":null,"steel_rebar_diameter_min":null,"density":"7870 kg

In addition to retaining walls, sheet piles are commonly used in structures such as basements, protecting riverbanks, quay walls, port structures, construction in water (cofferdams) and so forth. As most construction steel, steel sheet piles are fully recyclable. The product can be also be reused directly; temporary constructions, which lasts up to 3-5 years, can be reused several times without losing their inherent properties. The specific steel sheet piling in this EPD is produced in China. The products are made of hot rolled sections, shaped to so-called U-profiles and Z-profiles. The products are delivered in varying dimensions, and are delivered according to EN 10025 for construction steel with the product based on EN10248-1/2. Steel grades are S270GP, S355GP, S390GP, and S430GP. World Steel Association data for rolled steel sections (Asia) is used for A1.

It is ideal for use in building slabs in all types of buildings as steel roofing deck. Steel manufactured by Ternium in its Guerrero Industrial Works for Ternium Losacero production uses 70% iron ore (direct reduced iron) and 30% steel scrap as source of iron. Ternium Losacero has three main functions: 1) To act as a work platform during construction, that is, it serves as a formwork for the casting, 2) To provide positive reinforcement by bending to the concrete slab and 3) To provide resistance for horizontal loads. Ternium Mexico manufactures several types of Ternium Losacero, the difference between the types of Ternium Losacero lies in the size of the cant, which provides specific characteristics during installation.","open_xpd_uuid":"ec3gr7h5","resilient_flooring_thickness":null,"masonry_cement_astm_c91_type":null,"cmu_glass_powder_containing":null,"steel_rebar_diameter_min":null,"density":"7870 kg
