Concrete is a leading supplier of ready-mix concrete in New Zealand. As a large national concrete supplier, Allied Concrete can lead and influence change. Alongside many other environmental initiatives, in 2014, Allied Concrete made a conscious decision to start measuring emissions and released an Environmental Product Declaration (EPD). The EPD is a commitment to being guided by objectively measurable practices and is a testament to our transparency. We are using EPD data to guide our resourcing, energy choices, waste, and production practices and have proudly cut our CO² emissions by over 20% leading into our last measured year of production. This EPD presents a cradle-to-gate declaration of the environmental impact of Allied Concrete’s ready-mix concrete using cement imported into New Zealand by Holcim NZ Limited.

Concrete is a leading supplier of ready-mix concrete in New Zealand. As a large national concrete supplier, Allied Concrete can lead and influence change. Alongside many other environmental initiatives, in 2014, Allied Concrete made a conscious decision to start measuring emissions and released an Environmental Product Declaration (EPD). The EPD is a commitment to being guided by objectively measurable practices and is a testament to our transparency. We are using EPD data to guide our resourcing, energy choices, waste, and production practices and have proudly cut our CO² emissions by over 20% leading into our last measured year of production. This EPD presents a cradle-to-gate declaration of the environmental impact of Allied Concrete’s ready-mix concrete using cement imported into New Zealand by Holcim NZ Limited.

Concrete is a leading supplier of ready-mix concrete in New Zealand. As a large national concrete supplier, Allied Concrete can lead and influence change. Alongside many other environmental initiatives, in 2014, Allied Concrete made a conscious decision to start measuring emissions and released an Environmental Product Declaration (EPD). The EPD is a commitment to being guided by objectively measurable practices and is a testament to our transparency. We are using EPD data to guide our resourcing, energy choices, waste, and production practices and have proudly cut our CO² emissions by over 20% leading into our last measured year of production. This EPD presents a cradle-to-gate declaration of the environmental impact of Allied Concrete’s ready-mix concrete using cement imported into New Zealand by Holcim NZ Limited. It covers raw material supply, transportation, and

Concrete is a leading supplier of ready-mix concrete in New Zealand. As a large national concrete supplier, Allied Concrete can lead and influence change. Alongside many other environmental initiatives, in 2014, Allied Concrete made a conscious decision to start measuring emissions and released an Environmental Product Declaration (EPD). The EPD is a commitment to being guided by objectively measurable practices and is a testament to our transparency. We are using EPD data to guide our resourcing, energy choices, waste, and production practices and have proudly cut our CO² emissions by over 20% leading into our last measured year of production. This EPD presents a cradle-to-gate declaration of the environmental impact of Allied Concrete’s ready-mix concrete using cement imported into New Zealand by Holcim NZ Limited.

Concrete is a leading supplier of ready-mix concrete in New Zealand. As a large national concrete supplier, Allied Concrete can lead and influence change. Alongside many other environmental initiatives, in 2014, Allied Concrete made a conscious decision to start measuring emissions and released an Environmental Product Declaration (EPD). The EPD is a commitment to being guided by objectively measurable practices and is a testament to our transparency. We are using EPD data to guide our resourcing, energy choices, waste, and production practices and have proudly cut our CO² emissions by over 20% leading into our last measured year of production. This EPD presents a cradle-to-gate declaration of the environmental impact of Allied Concrete’s ready-mix concrete using cement imported into New Zealand by Holcim NZ Limited. It covers raw material supply, transportation, and

Concrete is a leading supplier of ready-mix concrete in New Zealand. As a large national concrete supplier, Allied Concrete can lead and influence change. Alongside many other environmental initiatives, in 2014, Allied Concrete made a conscious decision to start measuring emissions and released an Environmental Product Declaration (EPD). The EPD is a commitment to being guided by objectively measurable practices and is a testament to our transparency. We are using EPD data to guide our resourcing, energy choices, waste, and production practices and have proudly cut our CO² emissions by over 20% leading into our last measured year of production. This EPD presents a cradle-to-gate declaration of the environmental impact of Allied Concrete’s ready-mix concrete using cement imported into New Zealand by Holcim NZ Limited.

Concrete is a leading supplier of ready-mix concrete in New Zealand. As a large national concrete supplier, Allied Concrete can lead and influence change. Alongside many other environmental initiatives, in 2014, Allied Concrete made a conscious decision to start measuring emissions and released an Environmental Product Declaration (EPD). The EPD is a commitment to being guided by objectively measurable practices and is a testament to our transparency. We are using EPD data to guide our resourcing, energy choices, waste, and production practices and have proudly cut our CO² emissions by over 20% leading into our last measured year of production. This EPD presents a cradle-to-gate declaration of the environmental impact of Allied Concrete’s ready-mix concrete using cement imported into New Zealand by Holcim NZ Limited. It covers raw material supply, transportation, and

Concrete is a leading supplier of ready-mix concrete in New Zealand. As a large national concrete supplier, Allied Concrete can lead and influence change. Alongside many other environmental initiatives, in 2014, Allied Concrete made a conscious decision to start measuring emissions and released an Environmental Product Declaration (EPD). The EPD is a commitment to being guided by objectively measurable practices and is a testament to our transparency. We are using EPD data to guide our resourcing, energy choices, waste, and production practices and have proudly cut our CO² emissions by over 20% leading into our last measured year of production. This EPD presents a cradle-to-gate declaration of the environmental impact of Allied Concrete’s ready-mix concrete using cement imported into New Zealand by Holcim NZ Limited.

Concrete is a leading supplier of ready-mix concrete in New Zealand. As a large national concrete supplier, Allied Concrete can lead and influence change. Alongside many other environmental initiatives, in 2014, Allied Concrete made a conscious decision to start measuring emissions and released an Environmental Product Declaration (EPD). The EPD is a commitment to being guided by objectively measurable practices and is a testament to our transparency. We are using EPD data to guide our resourcing, energy choices, waste, and production practices and have proudly cut our CO² emissions by over 20% leading into our last measured year of production. This EPD presents a cradle-to-gate declaration of the environmental impact of Allied Concrete’s ready-mix concrete using cement imported into New Zealand by Holcim NZ Limited.

Concrete is a leading supplier of ready-mix concrete in New Zealand. As a large national concrete supplier, Allied Concrete can lead and influence change. Alongside many other environmental initiatives, in 2014, Allied Concrete made a conscious decision to start measuring emissions and released an Environmental Product Declaration (EPD). The EPD is a commitment to being guided by objectively measurable practices and is a testament to our transparency. We are using EPD data to guide our resourcing, energy choices, waste, and production practices and have proudly cut our CO² emissions by over 20% leading into our last measured year of production. This EPD presents a cradle-to-gate declaration of the environmental impact of Allied Concrete’s ready-mix concrete using cement imported into New Zealand by Holcim NZ Limited. It covers raw material supply, transportation, and

Concrete is a leading supplier of ready-mix concrete in New Zealand. As a large national concrete supplier, Allied Concrete can lead and influence change. Alongside many other environmental initiatives, in 2014, Allied Concrete made a conscious decision to start measuring emissions and released an Environmental Product Declaration (EPD). The EPD is a commitment to being guided by objectively measurable practices and is a testament to our transparency. We are using EPD data to guide our resourcing, energy choices, waste, and production practices and have proudly cut our CO² emissions by over 20% leading into our last measured year of production. This EPD presents a cradle-to-gate declaration of the environmental impact of Allied Concrete’s ready-mix concrete using cement imported into New Zealand by Holcim NZ Limited. It covers raw material supply, transportation, and

Concrete is a leading supplier of ready-mix concrete in New Zealand. As a large national concrete supplier, Allied Concrete can lead and influence change. Alongside many other environmental initiatives, in 2014, Allied Concrete made a conscious decision to start measuring emissions and released an Environmental Product Declaration (EPD). The EPD is a commitment to being guided by objectively measurable practices and is a testament to our transparency. We are using EPD data to guide our resourcing, energy choices, waste, and production practices and have proudly cut our CO² emissions by over 20% leading into our last measured year of production. This EPD presents a cradle-to-gate declaration of the environmental impact of Allied Concrete’s ready-mix concrete using cement imported into New Zealand by Holcim NZ Limited.

Concrete is a leading supplier of ready-mix concrete in New Zealand. As a large national concrete supplier, Allied Concrete can lead and influence change. Alongside many other environmental initiatives, in 2014, Allied Concrete made a conscious decision to start measuring emissions and released an Environmental Product Declaration (EPD). The EPD is a commitment to being guided by objectively measurable practices and is a testament to our transparency. We are using EPD data to guide our resourcing, energy choices, waste, and production practices and have proudly cut our CO² emissions by over 20% leading into our last measured year of production. This EPD presents a cradle-to-gate declaration of the environmental impact of Allied Concrete’s ready-mix concrete using cement imported into New Zealand by Holcim NZ Limited. It covers raw material supply, transportation, and

Concrete is a leading supplier of ready-mix concrete in New Zealand. As a large national concrete supplier, Allied Concrete can lead and influence change. Alongside many other environmental initiatives, in 2014, Allied Concrete made a conscious decision to start measuring emissions and released an Environmental Product Declaration (EPD). The EPD is a commitment to being guided by objectively measurable practices and is a testament to our transparency. We are using EPD data to guide our resourcing, energy choices, waste, and production practices and have proudly cut our CO² emissions by over 20% leading into our last measured year of production. This EPD presents a cradle-to-gate declaration of the environmental impact of Allied Concrete’s ready-mix concrete using cement imported into New Zealand by Holcim NZ Limited.

Concrete is a leading supplier of ready-mix concrete in New Zealand. As a large national concrete supplier, Allied Concrete can lead and influence change. Alongside many other environmental initiatives, in 2014, Allied Concrete made a conscious decision to start measuring emissions and released an Environmental Product Declaration (EPD). The EPD is a commitment to being guided by objectively measurable practices and is a testament to our transparency. We are using EPD data to guide our resourcing, energy choices, waste, and production practices and have proudly cut our CO² emissions by over 20% leading into our last measured year of production. This EPD presents a cradle-to-gate declaration of the environmental impact of Allied Concrete’s ready-mix concrete using cement imported into New Zealand by Holcim NZ Limited. It covers raw material supply, transportation, and

Concrete is a leading supplier of ready-mix concrete in New Zealand. As a large national concrete supplier, Allied Concrete can lead and influence change. Alongside many other environmental initiatives, in 2014, Allied Concrete made a conscious decision to start measuring emissions and released an Environmental Product Declaration (EPD). The EPD is a commitment to being guided by objectively measurable practices and is a testament to our transparency. We are using EPD data to guide our resourcing, energy choices, waste, and production practices and have proudly cut our CO² emissions by over 20% leading into our last measured year of production. This EPD presents a cradle-to-gate declaration of the environmental impact of Allied Concrete’s ready-mix concrete using cement imported into New Zealand by Holcim NZ Limited. It covers raw material supply, transportation, and

Concrete is a leading supplier of ready-mix concrete in New Zealand. As a large national concrete supplier, Allied Concrete can lead and influence change. Alongside many other environmental initiatives, in 2014, Allied Concrete made a conscious decision to start measuring emissions and released an Environmental Product Declaration (EPD). The EPD is a commitment to being guided by objectively measurable practices and is a testament to our transparency. We are using EPD data to guide our resourcing, energy choices, waste, and production practices and have proudly cut our CO² emissions by over 20% leading into our last measured year of production. This EPD presents a cradle-to-gate declaration of the environmental impact of Allied Concrete’s ready-mix concrete using cement imported into New Zealand by Holcim NZ Limited.

Concrete is a leading supplier of ready-mix concrete in New Zealand. As a large national concrete supplier, Allied Concrete can lead and influence change. Alongside many other environmental initiatives, in 2014, Allied Concrete made a conscious decision to start measuring emissions and released an Environmental Product Declaration (EPD). The EPD is a commitment to being guided by objectively measurable practices and is a testament to our transparency. We are using EPD data to guide our resourcing, energy choices, waste, and production practices and have proudly cut our CO² emissions by over 20% leading into our last measured year of production. This EPD presents a cradle-to-gate declaration of the environmental impact of Allied Concrete’s ready-mix concrete using cement imported into New Zealand by Holcim NZ Limited. It covers raw material supply, transportation, and

Concrete is a leading supplier of ready-mix concrete in New Zealand. As a large national concrete supplier, Allied Concrete can lead and influence change. Alongside many other environmental initiatives, in 2014, Allied Concrete made a conscious decision to start measuring emissions and released an Environmental Product Declaration (EPD). The EPD is a commitment to being guided by objectively measurable practices and is a testament to our transparency. We are using EPD data to guide our resourcing, energy choices, waste, and production practices and have proudly cut our CO² emissions by over 20% leading into our last measured year of production. This EPD presents a cradle-to-gate declaration of the environmental impact of Allied Concrete’s ready-mix concrete using cement imported into New Zealand by Holcim NZ Limited. It covers raw material supply, transportation, and

Concrete is a leading supplier of ready-mix concrete in New Zealand. As a large national concrete supplier, Allied Concrete can lead and influence change. Alongside many other environmental initiatives, in 2014, Allied Concrete made a conscious decision to start measuring emissions and released an Environmental Product Declaration (EPD). The EPD is a commitment to being guided by objectively measurable practices and is a testament to our transparency. We are using EPD data to guide our resourcing, energy choices, waste, and production practices and have proudly cut our CO² emissions by over 20% leading into our last measured year of production. This EPD presents a cradle-to-gate declaration of the environmental impact of Allied Concrete’s ready-mix concrete using cement imported into New Zealand by Holcim NZ Limited.

We are using EPD data to guide our resourcing, energy choices, waste, and production practices and have proudly cut our CO² emissions by over 20% leading into our last measured year of production. This EPD presents a cradle-to-gate declaration of the environmental impact of Allied Concrete’s ready-mix concrete using cement imported into New Zealand by Holcim NZ Limited. It covers raw material supply, transportation, and manufacturing.","open_xpd_uuid":"ec3re58r","resilient_flooring_thickness":null,"masonry_cement_astm_c91_type":null,"cmu_glass_powder_containing":null,"steel_rebar_diameter_min":null,"density":"2420

Concrete is a leading supplier of ready-mix concrete in New Zealand. As a large national concrete supplier, Allied Concrete can lead and influence change. Alongside many other environmental initiatives, in 2014, Allied Concrete made a conscious decision to start measuring emissions and released an Environmental Product Declaration (EPD). The EPD is a commitment to being guided by objectively measurable practices and is a testament to our transparency. We are using EPD data to guide our resourcing, energy choices, waste, and production practices and have proudly cut our CO² emissions by over 20% leading into our last measured year of production. This EPD presents a cradle-to-gate declaration of the environmental impact of Allied Concrete’s ready-mix concrete using cement imported into New Zealand by Holcim NZ Limited. It covers raw material supply, transportation, and

Concrete is a leading supplier of ready-mix concrete in New Zealand. As a large national concrete supplier, Allied Concrete can lead and influence change. Alongside many other environmental initiatives, in 2014, Allied Concrete made a conscious decision to start measuring emissions and released an Environmental Product Declaration (EPD). The EPD is a commitment to being guided by objectively measurable practices and is a testament to our transparency. We are using EPD data to guide our resourcing, energy choices, waste, and production practices and have proudly cut our CO² emissions by over 20% leading into our last measured year of production. This EPD presents a cradle-to-gate declaration of the environmental impact of Allied Concrete’s ready-mix concrete using cement imported into New Zealand by Holcim NZ Limited. It covers raw material supply, transportation, and

Concrete is a leading supplier of ready-mix concrete in New Zealand. As a large national concrete supplier, Allied Concrete can lead and influence change. Alongside many other environmental initiatives, in 2014, Allied Concrete made a conscious decision to start measuring emissions and released an Environmental Product Declaration (EPD). The EPD is a commitment to being guided by objectively measurable practices and is a testament to our transparency. We are using EPD data to guide our resourcing, energy choices, waste, and production practices and have proudly cut our CO² emissions by over 20% leading into our last measured year of production. This EPD presents a cradle-to-gate declaration of the environmental impact of Allied Concrete’s ready-mix concrete using cement imported into New Zealand by Holcim NZ Limited.

Concrete is a leading supplier of ready-mix concrete in New Zealand. As a large national concrete supplier, Allied Concrete can lead and influence change. Alongside many other environmental initiatives, in 2014, Allied Concrete made a conscious decision to start measuring emissions and released an Environmental Product Declaration (EPD). The EPD is a commitment to being guided by objectively measurable practices and is a testament to our transparency. We are using EPD data to guide our resourcing, energy choices, waste, and production practices and have proudly cut our CO² emissions by over 20% leading into our last measured year of production. This EPD presents a cradle-to-gate declaration of the environmental impact of Allied Concrete’s ready-mix concrete using cement imported into New Zealand by Holcim NZ Limited. It covers raw material supply, transportation, and

Concrete is a leading supplier of ready-mix concrete in New Zealand. As a large national concrete supplier, Allied Concrete can lead and influence change. Alongside many other environmental initiatives, in 2014, Allied Concrete made a conscious decision to start measuring emissions and released an Environmental Product Declaration (EPD). The EPD is a commitment to being guided by objectively measurable practices and is a testament to our transparency. We are using EPD data to guide our resourcing, energy choices, waste, and production practices and have proudly cut our CO² emissions by over 20% leading into our last measured year of production. This EPD presents a cradle-to-gate declaration of the environmental impact of Allied Concrete’s ready-mix concrete using cement imported into New Zealand by Holcim NZ Limited. It covers raw material supply, transportation, and

Concrete is a leading supplier of ready-mix concrete in New Zealand. As a large national concrete supplier, Allied Concrete can lead and influence change. Alongside many other environmental initiatives, in 2014, Allied Concrete made a conscious decision to start measuring emissions and released an Environmental Product Declaration (EPD). The EPD is a commitment to being guided by objectively measurable practices and is a testament to our transparency. We are using EPD data to guide our resourcing, energy choices, waste, and production practices and have proudly cut our CO² emissions by over 20% leading into our last measured year of production. This EPD presents a cradle-to-gate declaration of the environmental impact of Allied Concrete’s ready-mix concrete using cement imported into New Zealand by Holcim NZ Limited. It covers raw material supply, transportation, and

Concrete is a leading supplier of ready-mix concrete in New Zealand. As a large national concrete supplier, Allied Concrete can lead and influence change. Alongside many other environmental initiatives, in 2014, Allied Concrete made a conscious decision to start measuring emissions and released an Environmental Product Declaration (EPD). The EPD is a commitment to being guided by objectively measurable practices and is a testament to our transparency. We are using EPD data to guide our resourcing, energy choices, waste, and production practices and have proudly cut our CO² emissions by over 20% leading into our last measured year of production. This EPD presents a cradle-to-gate declaration of the environmental impact of Allied Concrete’s ready-mix concrete using cement imported into New Zealand by Holcim NZ Limited. It covers raw material supply, transportation, and

Concrete is a leading supplier of ready-mix concrete in New Zealand. As a large national concrete supplier, Allied Concrete can lead and influence change. Alongside many other environmental initiatives, in 2014, Allied Concrete made a conscious decision to start measuring emissions and released an Environmental Product Declaration (EPD). The EPD is a commitment to being guided by objectively measurable practices and is a testament to our transparency. We are using EPD data to guide our resourcing, energy choices, waste, and production practices and have proudly cut our CO² emissions by over 20% leading into our last measured year of production. This EPD presents a cradle-to-gate declaration of the environmental impact of Allied Concrete’s ready-mix concrete using cement imported into New Zealand by Holcim NZ Limited. It covers raw material supply, transportation, and

Concrete is a leading supplier of ready-mix concrete in New Zealand. As a large national concrete supplier, Allied Concrete can lead and influence change. Alongside many other environmental initiatives, in 2014, Allied Concrete made a conscious decision to start measuring emissions and released an Environmental Product Declaration (EPD). The EPD is a commitment to being guided by objectively measurable practices and is a testament to our transparency. We are using EPD data to guide our resourcing, energy choices, waste, and production practices and have proudly cut our CO² emissions by over 20% leading into our last measured year of production. This EPD presents a cradle-to-gate declaration of the environmental impact of Allied Concrete’s ready-mix concrete using cement imported into New Zealand by Holcim NZ Limited. It covers raw material supply, transportation, and

Concrete is a leading supplier of ready-mix concrete in New Zealand. As a large national concrete supplier, Allied Concrete can lead and influence change. Alongside many other environmental initiatives, in 2014, Allied Concrete made a conscious decision to start measuring emissions and released an Environmental Product Declaration (EPD). The EPD is a commitment to being guided by objectively measurable practices and is a testament to our transparency. We are using EPD data to guide our resourcing, energy choices, waste, and production practices and have proudly cut our CO² emissions by over 20% leading into our last measured year of production. This EPD presents a cradle-to-gate declaration of the environmental impact of Allied Concrete’s ready-mix concrete using cement imported into New Zealand by Holcim NZ Limited.

Concrete is a leading supplier of ready-mix concrete in New Zealand. As a large national concrete supplier, Allied Concrete can lead and influence change. Alongside many other environmental initiatives, in 2014, Allied Concrete made a conscious decision to start measuring emissions and released an Environmental Product Declaration (EPD). The EPD is a commitment to being guided by objectively measurable practices and is a testament to our transparency. We are using EPD data to guide our resourcing, energy choices, waste, and production practices and have proudly cut our CO² emissions by over 20% leading into our last measured year of production. This EPD presents a cradle-to-gate declaration of the environmental impact of Allied Concrete’s ready-mix concrete using cement imported into New Zealand by Holcim NZ Limited.

Concrete is a leading supplier of ready-mix concrete in New Zealand. As a large national concrete supplier, Allied Concrete can lead and influence change. Alongside many other environmental initiatives, in 2014, Allied Concrete made a conscious decision to start measuring emissions and released an Environmental Product Declaration (EPD). The EPD is a commitment to being guided by objectively measurable practices and is a testament to our transparency. We are using EPD data to guide our resourcing, energy choices, waste, and production practices and have proudly cut our CO² emissions by over 20% leading into our last measured year of production. This EPD presents a cradle-to-gate declaration of the environmental impact of Allied Concrete’s ready-mix concrete using cement imported into New Zealand by Holcim NZ Limited. It covers raw material supply, transportation, and

Concrete is a leading supplier of ready-mix concrete in New Zealand. As a large national concrete supplier, Allied Concrete can lead and influence change.

The EPD is a commitment to being guided by objectively measurable practices and is a testament to our transparency. We are using EPD data to guide our resourcing, energy choices, waste, and production practices and have proudly cut our CO² emissions by over 20% leading into our last measured year of production. This EPD presents a cradle-to-gate declaration of the environmental impact of Allied Concrete’s ready-mix concrete using cement imported into New Zealand by Holcim NZ Limited.

Concrete is a leading supplier of ready-mix concrete in New Zealand. As a large national concrete supplier, Allied Concrete can lead and influence change. Alongside many other environmental initiatives, in 2014, Allied Concrete made a conscious decision to start measuring emissions and released an Environmental Product Declaration (EPD). The EPD is a commitment to being guided by objectively measurable practices and is a testament to our transparency. We are using EPD data to guide our resourcing, energy choices, waste, and production practices and have proudly cut our CO² emissions by over 20% leading into our last measured year of production. This EPD presents a cradle-to-gate declaration of the environmental impact of Allied Concrete’s ready-mix concrete using cement imported into New Zealand by Holcim NZ Limited. It covers raw material supply, transportation, and

Concrete is a leading supplier of ready-mix concrete in New Zealand. As a large national concrete supplier, Allied Concrete can lead and influence change. Alongside many other environmental initiatives, in 2014, Allied Concrete made a conscious decision to start measuring emissions and released an Environmental Product Declaration (EPD). The EPD is a commitment to being guided by objectively measurable practices and is a testament to our transparency. We are using EPD data to guide our resourcing, energy choices, waste, and production practices and have proudly cut our CO² emissions by over 20% leading into our last measured year of production. This EPD presents a cradle-to-gate declaration of the environmental impact of Allied Concrete’s ready-mix concrete using cement imported into New Zealand by Holcim NZ Limited. It covers raw material supply, transportation, and

Alongside many other environmental initiatives, in 2014, Allied Concrete made a conscious decision to start measuring emissions and released an Environmental Product Declaration (EPD). The EPD is a commitment to being guided by objectively measurable practices and is a testament to our transparency. We are using EPD data to guide our resourcing, energy choices, waste, and production practices and have proudly cut our CO² emissions by over 20% leading into our last measured year of production. This EPD presents a cradle-to-gate declaration of the environmental impact of Allied Concrete’s ready-mix concrete using cement imported into New Zealand by Holcim NZ Limited. It covers raw material supply, transportation, and manufacturing.","open_xpd_uuid":"ec3xemh0","resilient_flooring_thickness":null,"masonry_cement_astm_c91_type":null,"cmu_glass_powder_containing":null,"steel_rebar_diameter_min":null,"density":"2350

Concrete is a leading supplier of ready-mix concrete in New Zealand. As a large national concrete supplier, Allied Concrete can lead and influence change. Alongside many other environmental initiatives, in 2014, Allied Concrete made a conscious decision to start measuring emissions and released an Environmental Product Declaration (EPD). The EPD is a commitment to being guided by objectively measurable practices and is a testament to our transparency. We are using EPD data to guide our resourcing, energy choices, waste, and production practices and have proudly cut our CO² emissions by over 20% leading into our last measured year of production. This EPD presents a cradle-to-gate declaration of the environmental impact of Allied Concrete’s ready-mix concrete using cement imported into New Zealand by Holcim NZ Limited.

Concrete is a leading supplier of ready-mix concrete in New Zealand. As a large national concrete supplier, Allied Concrete can lead and influence change. Alongside many other environmental initiatives, in 2014, Allied Concrete made a conscious decision to start measuring emissions and released an Environmental Product Declaration (EPD). The EPD is a commitment to being guided by objectively measurable practices and is a testament to our transparency. We are using EPD data to guide our resourcing, energy choices, waste, and production practices and have proudly cut our CO² emissions by over 20% leading into our last measured year of production. This EPD presents a cradle-to-gate declaration of the environmental impact of Allied Concrete’s ready-mix concrete using cement imported into New Zealand by Holcim NZ Limited. It covers raw material supply, transportation, and
