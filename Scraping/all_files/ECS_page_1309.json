 polyisocyanurate rigid  foam  (ISO  foam)  insulation features  a  high-performance  closed-cell  polyisocyanurate foam  core  sandwiched between  durable,  exterior  facers.  The facers  also  create a  barrier  which  minimizes  air  and vapor transmission. The insulation is  designed to deliver energy savings, weatherization protection and other benefits in  residential  and  commercial  wall  applications.  Dow’s  polyisocyanurate rigid  foam  (ISO  foam)  insulation  is  easy  to install,    can be  applied  to  a  variety  of  substrates,  satisfies  the  applicable  fire,  air  and water-resistive  barrier requirements, and maintains a consistently high R-value throughout the lif  ecycle of the building. Dow ISO foam insulation products are categorized into two product families: TUFF-RTM and THERMAXTM. The TUFF- RTM products  are  primarily,  but  not  exclusively,  used  in  residential  applic  ations.  The TUFF-RTM products  consist  of polyisocyanurate foam, faced with trilaminate facers made up of foil,   Kraft paper, and polyester films. THERMAXTM products  are  primarily but  not  exclusively used in  commercial buildings  and can  be left  exposed to  the interior  of  those  buildings  after  installation  because  of  their  resistance  to  fire.  The product  consists  of  trimer  foam, faced with  aluminum  foil  at  different  thicknesses. THERMAXTM and most  TUFF-RTM products  have  glass  fiber  in  the foam core that improves fire resistance.","open_xpd_uuid":"ec3gkqmj","resilient_flooring_thickness":null,"masonry_cement_astm_c91_type":null,"cmu_glass_powder_containing":null,"steel_rebar_diameter_min":null,"density":null,"access_flooring_finish_material":null,"concrete_compressive_strength_other_d":null,"wall_base_material":null,"gwp":"5.96

STYROFOAM™ insulation can be broadly categorized into two products: STYROFOAM™ and STYROFOAM™ Ultra  insulation.  STYROFOAM™    extruded  polystyrene  foam  provides  an  R  value  of  5  h·ft2·°F/Btu  per  inch;  STYROFOAM™  Ultra  uses  patented  carbon  black  materials  in  the  foam  for  better  thermal  performance  over  other  extruded polystyrene foam insulations. This enhanced formulation helps the foam to absorb infrared radiation, slowing transmission through the foam and lowering heat flow, and yields an R value of 5.6 h·ft2·°F/Btu per inch. The insulation is designed to deliver energy savings, weatherization protection and other benefits in residential and commercial wall applications.  STYROFOAMTM insulation  is  easy  to  install,  can  be  applied  to  a  variety  of  substrates,  satisfies  the  applicable fire, air and water-resistive barrier requirements, and maintains a consistently high R-value throughout the lifecycle of the

NGX™ XPS Insulation is a comprehensive line of rigid foam products that are easy to use, resist water absorption, deliver high compressive strength and maintain a high R-value throughout the life of the building.* It has third-party certified recycled content - certified by SCS Global Services - and, in addition is GREENGUARD Gold certified, offers the the industry’s only lifetime limited warranty.* FOAMULAR® NGX™ XPS Insulation is made with Owens Corning’s patented Hydrovac® process technology under strict quality control measures, which makes it highly resistant to moisture and permits the product to retain its high R-value year after year even after prolonged exposure to moisture and freeze/thaw cycling. Another primary difference with FOAMULAR® NGX™ XPS Insulation products is its compressive strength. FOAMULAR® NGX™ XPS Insulation has compressive strengths of 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 60 and 100 psi. The variety of products provides different strengths for use in walls, where there is almost no compressive load, or intermediate strength product for use with modest loads such as around foundations, or in low slope roofs. It also is suitable for use under high load pavement, such as floors or plaza decks.

EPD-en beskriver EPS isolasjon, fremstilt av bedrifter i EPS-gruppen, i henhold til NS-EN 13163. Ekspandert\rpolystyren, EPS, er den vanligste skumplastisolasjonen for isolering av bygningskonstruksjoner. EPS består av lukkede luftfylte celler, og inneholder ca. 98% luft, hvilket gir lav vekt og gode isolerende egenskaper. Produktet brukes i Norge som regel til varmeisolering av bygninger og kommer i mange dimensjoner med et stort utvalg av lambda- og trykklasser. EPS isolasjon kan brukes overalt i bygninger: til gulv på grunn, i vegger og tak.Som utgangspunkt for livsløpsvurderingen er det beregnet miljøresultater for trykklasse 80 kN/m2, men det er\rogså oppgitt en konverteringstabell for andre trykklasser. Tettheten for produktet ved 80 kN/m2 er ca 16 kg/m3, og tettheten øker med økende trykklasse. Resultatene i denne EPD- en gjelder for EPS isolasjon uten tilsats av flammehemmere\reller andre stoffer som påvirker materialegenskapene. EPS har svært lang levetid, utmerkede isolasjonsegenskaper, lav fuktabsorpsjon og høy trykkfasthet. Produksjonsprosessene omfatter en kombinasjon av varme og trykk og benytter rene teknologier som er minimalt energi- og vannkrevende ettersom energien gjenvinnes i en lukket krets. Dette gjør produksjonen av EPS svært effektiv. Det dannes ikke noe fast avfall, og avkapp blir umiddelbart ført tilbake i produksjonen.","open_xpd_uuid":"ec3s3nuq","resilient_flooring_thickness":null,"masonry_cement_astm_c91_type":null,"cmu_glass_powder_containing":null,"steel_rebar_diameter_min":null,"density":"16 kg /

NGX™ XPS Insulation is a comprehensive line of rigid foam products that are easy to use, resist water absorption, deliver high compressive strength and maintain a high R-value throughout the life of the building.* It has third-party certified recycled content - certified by SCS Global Services - and, in addition is GREENGUARD Gold certified, offers the the industry’s only lifetime limited warranty.* FOAMULAR® NGX™ XPS Insulation is made with Owens Corning’s patented Hydrovac® process technology under strict quality control measures, which makes it highly resistant to moisture and permits the product to retain its high R-value year after year even after prolonged exposure to moisture and freeze/thaw cycling. Another primary difference with FOAMULAR® NGX™ XPS Insulation products is its compressive strength. FOAMULAR® NGX™ XPS Insulation has compressive strengths of 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 60 and 100 psi. The variety of products provides different strengths for use in walls, where there is almost no compressive load, or intermediate strength product for use with modest loads such as around foundations, or in low slope roofs. It also is suitable for use under high load pavement, such as floors or plaza decks. FOAMULAR® NGX™ XPS Insulation is an integral component of our Owens Corning® ResidentialComplete® Wall Systems and the Owens Corning® CommercialComplete® Wall Systems portfolios. FOAMULAR® NGX™ contains the additional benefit of being manufactured with a blowing agent formulation that delivers a 90% reduction to Global Warming Potential (100 year) compared to FOAMULAR® blowing agent, including the complete elimination of HFC

NGX™ XPS Insulation is a comprehensive line of rigid foam products that are easy to use, resist water absorption, deliver high compressive strength and maintain a high R-value throughout the life of the building.* It has third-party certified recycled content - certified by SCS Global Services - and, in addition is GREENGUARD Gold certified, offers the the industry’s only lifetime limited warranty.* FOAMULAR® NGX™ XPS Insulation is made with Owens Corning’s patented Hydrovac® process technology under strict quality control measures, which makes it highly resistant to moisture and permits the product to retain its high R-value year after year even after prolonged exposure to moisture and freeze/thaw cycling. Another primary difference with FOAMULAR® NGX™ XPS Insulation products is its compressive strength. FOAMULAR® NGX™ XPS Insulation has compressive strengths of 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 60 and 100 psi. The variety of products provides different strengths for use in walls, where there is almost no compressive load, or intermediate strength product for use with modest loads such as around foundations, or in low slope roofs. It also is suitable for use under high load pavement, such as floors or plaza decks. FOAMULAR® NGX™ XPS Insulation is an integral component of our Owens Corning® ResidentialComplete® Wall Systems and the Owens Corning® CommercialComplete® Wall Systems portfolios. FOAMULAR® NGX™ contains the additional benefit of being manufactured with a blowing agent formulation that delivers a 90% reduction to Global Warming Potential (100 year) compared to FOAMULAR® blowing agent, including the complete elimination of HFC

NGX™ XPS Insulation is a comprehensive line of rigid foam products that are easy to use, resist water absorption, deliver high compressive strength and maintain a high R-value throughout the life of the building.* It has third-party certified recycled content - certified by SCS Global Services - and, in addition is GREENGUARD Gold certified, offers the the industry’s only lifetime limited warranty.* FOAMULAR® NGX™ XPS Insulation is made with Owens Corning’s patented Hydrovac® process technology under strict quality control measures, which makes it highly resistant to moisture and permits the product to retain its high R-value year after year even after prolonged exposure to moisture and freeze/thaw cycling. Another primary difference with FOAMULAR® NGX™ XPS Insulation products is its compressive strength. FOAMULAR® NGX™ XPS Insulation has compressive strengths of 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 60 and 100 psi. The variety of products provides different strengths for use in walls, where there is almost no compressive load, or intermediate strength product for use with modest loads such as around foundations, or in low slope roofs. It also is suitable for use under high load pavement, such as floors or plaza decks. FOAMULAR® NGX™ XPS Insulation is an integral component of our Owens Corning® ResidentialComplete® Wall Systems and the Owens Corning® CommercialComplete® Wall Systems portfolios. FOAMULAR® NGX™ contains the additional benefit of being manufactured with a blowing agent formulation that delivers a 90% reduction to Global Warming Potential (100 year) compared to FOAMULAR® blowing agent, including the complete elimination of HFC

NGX™ XPS Insulation is a comprehensive line of rigid foam products that are easy to use, resist water absorption, deliver high compressive strength and maintain a high R-value throughout the life of the building.* It has third-party certified recycled content - certified by SCS Global Services - and, in addition is GREENGUARD Gold certified, offers the the industry’s only lifetime limited warranty.* FOAMULAR® NGX™ XPS Insulation is made with Owens Corning’s patented Hydrovac® process technology under strict quality control measures, which makes it highly resistant to moisture and permits the product to retain its high R-value year after year even after prolonged exposure to moisture and freeze/thaw cycling. Another primary difference with FOAMULAR® NGX™ XPS Insulation products is its compressive strength. FOAMULAR® NGX™ XPS Insulation has compressive strengths of 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 60 and 100 psi. The variety of products provides different strengths for use in walls, where there is almost no compressive load, or intermediate strength product for use with modest loads such as around foundations, or in low slope roofs. It also is suitable for use under high load pavement, such as floors or plaza decks. FOAMULAR® NGX™ XPS Insulation is an integral component of our Owens Corning® ResidentialComplete® Wall Systems and the Owens Corning® CommercialComplete® Wall Systems portfolios. FOAMULAR® NGX™ contains the additional benefit of being manufactured with a blowing agent formulation that delivers a 90% reduction to Global Warming Potential (100 year) compared to FOAMULAR® blowing agent, including the complete elimination of HFC

Product Declaration(EPD®) describes the environmental impacts of1 m² ofmineralwool with a thermalresistance of 1.0K*m2*W-1.The production site ofSaint-Gobain Italia SpA in Vidalengo di Caravaggio (BG) uses natural raw materials (sand),  using fusion and fiberising techniques to  produce mineralwool. The products obtained come in the form of a \"mineral wool mat\" consisting of a soft, airy structure.On Earth, naturally, the best insulator is dry immobile air at 20°C:its thermal conductivity factor, expressed in λ,  is  0.025  W/(m.K)  (watts  per  meter  Kelvin  degree).  The  thermal  conductivity  of mineralwool  is  close  to immobile airas its lambda varies from 0.031W/(m.K) for the most efficient to 0.043W/(m.K) to the least. With  its  entangled  structure, mineralwool  is  a  porous  material  that  traps  the  air,  making  it  one  of  the  best insulating materials. The porous and elastic structure of the wool also absorbs  noise in the air, knocks and offers acoustic correction inside premises. Mineral wool containing incombustible materials does not fuel fire or propagate flames.Glass  wool  insulation is  used  in  buildings  as  well  as  industrial  facilities.  It  ensures  a  high  level  of  comfort, lowers  energy  costs,  minimizes  carbon  dioxide  (CO2)  emissions,  prevents  heat  loss  through  pitched  roofs, walls, floors, pipes and boilers, reduces noise pollution and protects homes and industrial facilities from the risk of fire.Glasswool products last for the average building’s lifetime (which is often set at 50 years as a default), or as long as the insulated building component is part of the building.The glass wool products in this EPD are identified as products belonging to a family called “ARENA” and “T”.","open_xpd_uuid":"ec386294","resilient_flooring_thickness":null,"masonry_cement_astm_c91_type":null,"cmu_glass_powder_containing":null,"steel_rebar_diameter_min":null,"density":"22 kg /

Product Declaration(EPD®) describes the environmental impacts of1 m² ofmineralwool with a thermalresistance of 1.0K*m2*W-1.The production site ofSaint-Gobain Italia SpA in Vidalengo di Caravaggio (BG) uses natural raw materials (sand),  using fusion and fiberising techniques to  produce mineralwool. The products obtained come in the form of a \"mineral wool mat\" consisting of a soft, airy structure.On Earth, naturally, the best insulator is dry immobile air at 20°C: its thermal conductivity factor, expressed in λ,  is  0.025  W/(m.K)  (watts  per  meter  Kelvin  degree).  The  thermal  conductivity  of mineralwool  is  close  to immobile airas its lambda varies from 0.031W/(m.K) for the most efficient to 0.043W/(m.K) to the least. With  its  entangled  structure, mineralwoolis  a  porous  material  that  traps  the  air,  making  it  one  of  the  best insulating materials. The porous and elastic structure of the wool also absorbs  noise in the air, knocks and offers acoustic correction inside premises. Mineral wool containing incombustible materials does not fuel fire or propagate flames.Glass  wool  insulation is  used  in  buildings  as  well  as industrial  facilities.  It  ensures  a  high  level  of  comfort, lowers  energy  costs,  minimizes  carbon  dioxide  (CO2)  emissions,  prevents  heat  loss  throughpitched  roofs, walls, floors, pipes and boilers, reduces noise pollution and protects homes and industrial facilities from the risk of fire.Glasswool products last for the average building’s lifetime (which is often set at 50 years as a default), or aslong as the insulated building component is part of the building.The glass wool products in this EPD are identified as products belonging to a family called “G3with facing”.","open_xpd_uuid":"ec38cgkh","resilient_flooring_thickness":null,"masonry_cement_astm_c91_type":null,"cmu_glass_powder_containing":null,"steel_rebar_diameter_min":null,"density":"95 kg /

The products obtained come in the form of a \"mineral wool mat\" consisting of a soft, airy structure.On Earth, naturally, the best insulator is dry immobile air at 20°C: its thermal conductivity factor, expressed in λ,  is  0.025  W/(m.K)  (watts  per  meter  Kelvin  degree).  The  thermal  conductivity  of mineralwool  is  close  to immobile airas its lambda varies from 0.031W/(m.K) for the most efficient to 0.043W/(m.K) to the least. With  its  entangled  structure, mineralwool  is  a  porous  material  that  traps  the  air,  making  it  one  of  the  best insulating materials. The porous and elastic structure of the wool also absorbs  noise in the air, knocks and offers acoustic correction inside premises. Mineral wool containing incombustible materials does not fuel fire or propagate flames.Glass  wool  insulation is  used  in  buildings  as  well  as  industrial  facilities.  It  ensures  a  high  level  of  comfort, lowers  energy  costs,  minimizes  carbon  dioxide  (CO2)  emissions,  prevents  heat  loss through  pitched  roofs, walls, floors, pipes and boilers, reduces noise pollution and protects homes and industrial facilities from the risk of fire.Glasswool products last for the average building’s lifetime (which is often set at 50 years as a default), or as long as the insulated building component is part of the building.The glass wool products in this EPD are identified as products belonging to a family called “ARENA” and “T”with facing.","open_xpd_uuid":"ec31se0g","resilient_flooring_thickness":null,"masonry_cement_astm_c91_type":null,"cmu_glass_powder_containing":null,"steel_rebar_diameter_min":null,"density":"32 kg /

Following years of research and development we are proud to offer a unique, innovative and high-tech product with no need for the regular maintenance usually required by other wood exteriors.We created a highly resistant PVDF outer film that protects ProdEX from nature's elements, creating a product which is totally maintenance free. This PVDF film is also anti-graffiti and non-stick, preventing organic matter from developing on the panel's surface and reducing the build-up of dust and dirt from ambient pollution.By the pool or spa we can also enjoy the beauty of a ProdIN product (by Prodema). Because thanks to the Neptuno range, wood is getting closer to water than ever without any problem, providing a touch of warmth to otherwise somewhat cold spaces (swimming pools, spas and even bathrooms).","open_xpd_uuid":"ec31gc4y","resilient_flooring_thickness":null,"masonry_cement_astm_c91_type":null,"cmu_glass_powder_containing":null,"steel_rebar_diameter_min":null,"density":"562.5 kg /

- Gobain Isover UK, which has a production site situated in Runcorn, utilizes a variety of fusion and fiberizing techniques to convert natural and abundant raw materials (Sand, Borax, and Feldspar etc.) as well as Cullet into a homogeneous melt, which is subsequently fabricated into glass wool fibres. These glass wool fibres are formed into a “mineral wool mat” consisting of a soft, airy structure The best natural insulator on earth is dry immobile air at 10°C: its thermal conductivity factor, expressed in λ, is 0.025 W/(m.K) (watts per meter Kelvin degree). The thermal conductivity of glass mineral wool is close to immobile air as its λ (Lambda) varies from 0.032 W/(m.K) for the most efficient to 0.044 W/(m.K) for the least. The glass mineral wool products have an entangled, porous structure: This enables air to become trapped in the pores of the material providing exceptional thermal properties. Furthermore, its porous and elastic structure absorbs noise in the air and offers acoustic correction inside premises. Incombustible by nature, Isover glass mineral wool does not fuel fire or propagate flames. Glass mineral wool insulation usage is extensive, ranging from use in building insulation (loft, cavity walls) to technical insulation (Industrial facilities, Marine & offshore). It ensures a high level of comfort, lowers energy costs, minimizes carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, prevents heat loss through pitched roofs, walls, floors, pipes and boilers, reduces noise pollution and protects homes and industrial facilities from the risk of fire. Moreover, Isover insulation allows substantial weight savings for marine applications. The glass mineral wool products generated at Saint - Gobain Isover UK have an average building lifespan of 60 years, or as long as the insulated building component is part of the building.

The systems include also: - Klima Flex and Keraklima Eco, single-component mineral adhesivefinishing products, specifically intended for laying and levelling systems made of extruded polystyrene, expanded polystyrene and polystyrene foam, polyurethane, cork, mineral and glass wool panels laid on concrete, clay block, cement-based plaster and mineral and cement-based finishing products. They are used both as adhesive and smoothing layer. - Kerakover Eco Acrilex Fondo, mineral intermediate coat to prepare substrates for the paint cycle. Based on water-based acrylic resins, for internal and external surfaces, it is a high power filler to correct imperfections in the substrate. Specifically intended for filling stabilized crazing and evening out absorption - Kerakover Eco Kompact, fibrous, mineral covering, completely coloured, based on water-based acrylic-siloxane resins and waterproofing siloxanes.

S.p.A. has been manufacturing insulation panels for construction services and interior design in its innovative production plant in Onara di Tombolo (PD - Italy); CELENIT is one of the flagship player in providing thermal and acoustic solutions and for the indoor comfort to Italian and international markets, thanks to the various solutions offered, in cooperation with Universities and to several laboratory test and certifications, performed according to the international standards.The CELENIT panels are made of spruce wood coming from sustainable management forests (PEFCTM and FSC®) and mineral binders, mainly Portland cement and marble dust.

S.p.A. has been manufacturing insulation panels for construction services and interior design in its innovative production plant in Onara di Tombolo (PD - Italy); CELENIT is one of the flagship player in providing thermal and acoustic solutions and for the indoor comfort to Italian and international markets, thanks to the various solutions offered, in cooperation with Universities and to several laboratory test and certifications, performed according to the international standards.The CELENIT panels are made of spruce wood coming from sustainable management forests (PEFCTM and FSC®) and mineral binders, mainly Portland cement and marble dust. The wood wool is subjected to a mineralization treatment, which stops the biologic deterioration -while maintaining the same mechanical properties- makes the fibers inert and increases the fire resistance. The wood wool is coated with Portland cement, and bound together under pressure to form a stable, resistant, compact and durable structure. The products are compliant to the EN 13168 standard \"Thermal insulation products for buildings. Factory made wood wool (WW) products\" and to the EN 13964 \"Suspended ceilings. Requirements and test methods\".The main applications of the wood wool panels are related to building insulations and acoustic coverings. In the first case, panels made of wood wool with a standard texture and grey Portland cement (CELENIT N) are used for the thermal-acoustic insulation of roof, walls, floors and permanent formwork. The standard, thin and extra-thin panels made of wood wool and white Portland cement (CELENIT NB, CELENIT AB, CELENIT ABE) or grey Portland cement (CELENIT A and CELENIT AE) are used for acoustic coverings such as ceilings, double walls, baffles and suspended islands or acoustic design elements.","open_xpd_uuid":"ec3rtat0","resilient_flooring_thickness":null,"masonry_cement_astm_c91_type":null,"cmu_glass_powder_containing":null,"steel_rebar_diameter_min":null,"density":"13 kg /
