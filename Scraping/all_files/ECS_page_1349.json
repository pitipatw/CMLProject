definition Cement is a hydraulic binder. It consists of finely ground, non-metallic inorganic compounds. Cement is produced by grinding cement clinker and other main or minor constituents. When water is added to cement, a cement paste is formed, which sets and hardens by hydration reactions. After hardening, it retains its strength and stability even under water. The declared product Injektering 30 is a micro cement. It is produced by grinding EN 197-1-compliant CEM I 42,5 N-SR3/LA*)(Anläggningscement Std P Slite) in mills specially developed for micro cements. *) LA means Low alkali content according to Swedish standard, SS 134203. 2 The calculation is based on plant-specific data of Slite and Degerhamn in 2019/2020. For the use and application of the product the respective national provisions at the place of use apply. Application Injektering 30 has suitable penetration characteristics for grouting in geotechnical work (cement injection of cracks in rocks). Injektering 30 is chromate

is a blended cement confirming to IS 455:2015. It is most suitable for residential, commercial and industrial projects. At JSW Cement, superior quality slag produced at the steel-manufacturing plants is used, along with clinker and gypsum to create PSC, using state-of-the-art technology, through roller press and vertical roller mill. PSC is recognised as Green product. Some of the advantages of PSC are longer life, resistant to chemical attack, better surface for painting, less heat of hydration reduced thermal crack and incomparable long-term strength. The application areas of PSC include pile construction works, concrete roads and flyovers, water retaining structures, dams, marine works. Also, the PSC based concrete always shows higher strengths beyond 28 days in comparison to those made with OPC concrete and fly ash concrete.","open_xpd_uuid":"ec3k5q1n","resilient_flooring_thickness":null,"masonry_cement_astm_c91_type":null,"cmu_glass_powder_containing":null,"steel_rebar_diameter_min":null,"density":"1440 kg /

EPD reports environmental transparency information for two cement products, produced by Lehigh Cement at their Redding, California facility. These cements are hydraulic binders and are manufactured by grinding cement clinker and other main or minor constituents into a finely ground, usually grey colored mineral powder. Cement is just one ingredient in the mixture that creates concrete, but it is the most chemically active ingredient and crucial to the quality of the final product. When mixed with water, cement acts as a glue to bind together the sand, gravel or crushed stone to form concrete, one of the most durable, resilient and widely used construction materials in the world. These products are used for concrete and mortar as well as all the other various applications for cement, including engineered soils and solidification/stabilization of materials and wastes. DECLARED UNIT The declared unit is one metric tonne of Type I/II and Type II/V cement.

EPD reports environmental transparency information for two cement products, produced by Lehigh Cement at their Redding, California facility. These cements are hydraulic binders and are manufactured by grinding cement clinker and other main or minor constituents into a finely ground, usually grey colored mineral powder. Cement is just one ingredient in the mixture that creates concrete, but it is the most chemically active ingredient and crucial to the quality of the final product. When mixed with water, cement acts as a glue to bind together the sand, gravel or crushed stone to form concrete, one of the most durable, resilient and widely used construction materials in the world. These products are used for concrete and mortar as well as all the other various applications for cement, including engineered soils and solidification/stabilization of materials and wastes. DECLARED UNIT The declared unit is one metric tonne of Type I/II and Type II/V cement.

EPD reports environmental transparency information for five cement products, produced by Lehigh Cement at their Edmonton, Alberta, facility. These cements are hydraulic binders and are manufactured by grinding cement clinker and other main or minor constituents into a finely ground, usually grey colored mineral powder. Cement is just one ingredient in the mixture that creates concrete, but it is the most chemically active ingredient and crucial to the quality of the final product. When mixed with water, cement acts as a glue to bind together the sand, gravel or crushed stone to form concrete, one of the most durable, resilient and widely used construction materials in the world. Our environmentally friendly product is branded as EcoCem®PLUS and was developed to reduce embodied carbon (measured through GWP). This product is a general use limestone blended (GULb) and a high sulfate (HSLb) resistant product for concrete and mortar as well as all the other various applications for cement, including engineered soils and solidification/stabilization of materials and wastes. The Lehigh Edmonton plant oil well cement conforms to an American Petroleum Institute (API) Spec 10A Class G. This cement is used for oil well grouting or cementing and is able to withstand high temperatures and pressures of deep wells. DECLARED UNIT The declared unit is one metric tonne of GULb/HSLb, GU, HE, HS and OWG cement. SYSTEM BOUNDARY This EPD is a cradle-to-gate EPD covering A1-A3 stages of the life

EPD reports environmental transparency information for five cement products, produced by Lehigh Cement at their Edmonton, Alberta, facility. These cements are hydraulic binders and are manufactured by grinding cement clinker and other main or minor constituents into a finely ground, usually grey colored mineral powder. Cement is just one ingredient in the mixture that creates concrete, but it is the most chemically active ingredient and crucial to the quality of the final product. When mixed with water, cement acts as a glue to bind together the sand, gravel or crushed stone to form concrete, one of the most durable, resilient and widely used construction materials in the world. Our environmentally friendly product is branded as EcoCem®PLUS and was developed to reduce embodied carbon (measured through GWP). This product is a general use limestone blended (GULb) and a high sulfate (HSLb) resistant product for concrete and mortar as well as all the other various applications for cement, including engineered soils and solidification/stabilization of materials and wastes. The Lehigh Edmonton plant oil well cement conforms to an American Petroleum Institute (API) Spec 10A Class G. This cement is used for oil well grouting or cementing and is able to withstand high temperatures and pressures of deep wells. DECLARED UNIT The declared unit is one metric tonne of GULb/HSLb, GU, HE, HS and OWG cement. SYSTEM BOUNDARY This EPD is a cradle-to-gate EPD covering A1-A3 stages of the life cycle.","open_xpd_uuid":"ec3au4he","resilient_flooring_thickness":null,"masonry_cement_astm_c91_type":null,"cmu_glass_powder_containing":null,"steel_rebar_diameter_min":null,"density":"1440 kg /

EPD reports environmental transparency information for three cement products, produced by Lehigh Cement at their Bellingham, WA grinding facility. These cements are hydraulic binders and are manufactured by grinding cement clinker and other main or minor constituents into a finely ground, usually grey colored mineral powder. Cement is just one ingredient in the mixture that creates concrete, but it is the most chemically active ingredient and crucial to the quality of the final product. When mixed with water, cement acts as a glue to bind together the sand, gravel or crushed stone to form concrete, one of the most durable, resilient and widely used construction materials in the world. Our Type IL/GUL is branded as EcoCemPLC™ and was developed to be more environmentally friendly by reducing its carbon footprint (reduction measured through GWP). This product is a general use product for concrete and mortar as well as all the other various applications for cement, including engineered soils and solidification/stabilization of materials and wastes. DECLARED UNIT The declared unit is one metric tonne of Type IL, Type I/II and TYPE III cement.

These cements are hydraulic binders and are manufactured by grinding cement clinker and other main or minor constituents into a finely ground, usually grey colored mineral powder. Cement is just one ingredient in the mixture that creates concrete, but it is the most chemically active ingredient and crucial to the quality of the final product. When mixed with water, cement acts as a glue to bind together the sand, gravel or crushed stone to form concrete, one of the most durable, resilient and widely used construction materials in the world. Our GUL/Type IL is branded as EcoCem®PLC and was developed to be more environmentally friendly by reducing its carbon footprint (reduction measured through GWP). This product is a general use product for concrete and mortar as well as all the other various applications for cement, including engineered soils and solidification/stabilization of materials and wastes. DECLARED UNIT The declared unit is one metric tonne of GUL, GU and HE cement.

EPD reports environmental transparency information for three cement products, produced by Lehigh Cement at their Delta, BC facility. These cements are hydraulic binders and are manufactured by grinding cement clinker and other main or minor constituents into a finely ground, usually grey colored mineral powder. Cement is just one ingredient in the mixture that creates concrete, but it is the most chemically active ingredient and crucial to the quality of the final product. When mixed with water, cement acts as a glue to bind together the sand, gravel or crushed stone to form concrete, one of the most durable, resilient and widely used construction materials in the world. Our GUL/Type IL is branded as EcoCem®PLC and was developed to be more environmentally friendly by reducing its carbon footprint (reduction measured through GWP). This product is a general use product for concrete and mortar as well as all the other various applications for cement, including engineered soils and solidification/stabilization of materials and wastes. DECLARED UNIT The declared unit is one metric tonne of GUL, GU and HE cement.

EPD reports environmental transparency information for three cement products, produced by Lehigh Cement at their Delta, BC facility. These cements are hydraulic binders and are manufactured by grinding cement clinker and other main or minor constituents into a finely ground, usually grey colored mineral powder. Cement is just one ingredient in the mixture that creates concrete, but it is the most chemically active ingredient and crucial to the quality of the final product. When mixed with water, cement acts as a glue to bind together the sand, gravel or crushed stone to form concrete, one of the most durable, resilient and widely used construction materials in the world. Our GUL/Type IL is branded as EcoCem®PLC and was developed to be more environmentally friendly by reducing its carbon footprint (reduction measured through GWP). This product is a general use product for concrete and mortar as well as all the other various applications for cement, including engineered soils and solidification/stabilization of materials and wastes. DECLARED UNIT The declared unit is one metric tonne of GUL, GU and HE cement.

(New Zealand) Ltd is a leading supplier of cement and aggregates in New Zealand. Its involvement in the New Zealand building industry dates back to 1888. Holcim New Zealand is part of the regional Holcim Australia/New Zealand business and the global LafargeHolcim Group; the world's leading supplier of cement, aggregates and construction-related services represented in 90 countries on all continents. In 2016 Holcim NZ Ltd transitioned from a manufacturing cement model to an import model, sourcing bulk shipments of GP cement from Mitsubishi Materials Corporation in Japan. This EPD presents a 'cradle-to-gate' assessment of the environmental impacts of both bulk and bagged \"Ultracem\" general purpose cement. It covers from raw material extraction in Japan right the way through cement production, transportation to the import terminals in New Zealand and ends with regional depot operations including bagging of cement where this occurs. The life cycle assessment provides quantitative, objective and verified information, which Holcim NZ Ltd is able to utilize to continuously improve their products and processes.","open_xpd_uuid":"ec3q5nnk","resilient_flooring_thickness":null,"masonry_cement_astm_c91_type":null,"cmu_glass_powder_containing":null,"steel_rebar_diameter_min":null,"density":"1440 kg /

The PPC is a kind of blended cement which is produced by inter-grinding of OPC clinker along with gypsum and pozzolanic materials in certain proportions. About 25 percent of the company’s production of high strength PPC uses fly ash- a waste produced in thermal power plants- as raw material. Through use of state-of-the-art technology and strong thrust on research and development, Ambuja Cement has developed the product to cater to its three customer segments- individual house builders, masons and contractors, and professionals. Ambuja Compocem Ambuja Compocem is yet another breakthrough product innovation from Ambuja Cement. The company’s Chhattisgarh facility has become the first cement plant in India to develop a composite cement after rigorous research. The new offering is a combination of cement, flyash and slag. With this, the company has addressed two vital aspects from a customer's perspective- offering higher compressive strength and long-term durability. The advanced product caters to all segments- individual home buyers, and large real estate and infrastructure projects in India.","open_xpd_uuid":"ec3rukqg","resilient_flooring_thickness":null,"masonry_cement_astm_c91_type":null,"cmu_glass_powder_containing":null,"steel_rebar_diameter_min":null,"density":"1440 kg /

Roseburg HWPW is marketed and sold under the trademark name SkyPly®. The 2014 production data used in this EPD considers all HWPW produced during the year and is therefore weighted based on material output. The production data used in this EPD is presented in square meters, but includes the following possible dimensions: • Lengths: 8’, 10’ • Widths: 4’ • Thicknesses: 1/4” to 1-1/4” • Number of plies: 3, 5, 7, 9, 11 A wide variety of face species are used in the manufacture of Roseburg’s HWPW including walnut, alder, cherry, mahogany, oak, birch, and maple to name a few. In addition, there are variations on how the veneers are cut and matched that can provide hundreds of different decorative appearances in the finished panels. Roseburg also offers abundant choices in cores for these panels-from veneer core (predominately made from Douglas-fir and other western species) to composite wood cores such as medium density fiberboard and particleboard.

EPD covers Latvijas Finieris Group’s raw birch plywood (Riga Ply) with our new lignin based glue RIGA ECOlogical. We truly believe that this technological breakthrough is the most significant innovation in plywood products gluing since many decades and offers to all our customers an important competitive advantage in the increasingly green business environment. All woods contain 20-30% of lignin, a polymeric substance which together with cellulose binds together the wood fibers and cells. In our new green glue this bio-based renewable natural hardener lignin to a significant extent is used as replacement of the traditional fossil phenol. As a result all technical properties of RIGA Plywood remain unchanged, but the carbon footprint of RIGA Plywood is reduced from production to all its end-uses. Latvijas Finieris Group is a multi-sectoral company with core competence in birch based products, mainly excellence in birch plywood production. Our birch veneer and plywood production facilities are located in Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia and Finland. We are part of Nordic region, which is a global benchmark of sustainability practices, and Latvijas Finieris Group has established strict measures in order to guarantee that the production processes strive to minimize the impact on human health as well as on the environment. That includes usage of renewable energy, waste water, material and resource recycling, heat recuperation, emission cutting, energy efficiency in production and low mileage of raw material. Our wood supply chain is certified according to world’s leading sustainable forest management schemes, which means that all our long-term supply partners manage their forests according to best sustainable forestry practices. Latvijas Finieris is also actively involved in forest management, including our own tree nursery with an output of 1.5 million saplings per year. Our birch plywood products are sold in more than 60 countries, providing high-quality, service and

All panels are of a 3-ply construction having a face skin on top and bottom with a perpendicular core. On a typical ¾ (19mm) panel the face skins are approximately 3.5mm each and the core is 12mm. This construction is unique to bamboo plywood and is not found in any other wood panel product. The basic building block of the panel is a bamboo strip that measures approximately 0.6mm in thickness with a width of 22mm and a length of 2438mm for the plywood face skin and 1220mm for the plywood core. These strips are laminated together (using an adhesive), sliced and sanded to dimension for their specific application as face skin or core board. Using different lamination orientations, the core board and face skins are produced. There are two lamination methods that produce two different looks for the face skin. With the edge grain lamination, thin narrow laminations are used and for the flat grain, wider strip laminations are used. Ultra-low emitting adhesives (ULEF) are used in the assembly process and once trimmed to dimension and final sanded the boards are packaged and ready for shipment. Plyboo flat and edge grain bamboo products are available manufactured to the California Air Resource Board (CARB) Phase II Airborne Toxic Control Measure (ATCM) 93120 regulation and the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC®) 100% label requirements. The applicable CPC Code is UN CPC 3145 - Plywood, veneer panels and similar laminated wood of

All panels are of a 3-ply construction having a face skin on top and bottom with a perpendicular core. On a typical ¾ (19mm) panel the face skins are approximately 3.5mm each and the core is 12mm. This construction is unique to bamboo plywood and is not found in any other wood panel product. The basic building block of the panel is a bamboo strip that measures approximately 0.6mm in thickness with a width of 22mm and a length of 2438mm for the plywood face skin and 1220mm for the plywood core. These strips are laminated together (using an adhesive), sliced and sanded to dimension for their specific application as face skin or core board. Using different lamination orientations, the core board and face skins are produced. There are two lamination methods that produce two different looks for the face skin. With the edge grain lamination, thin narrow laminations are used and for the flat grain, wider strip laminations are used. Ultra-low emitting adhesives (ULEF) are used in the assembly process and once trimmed to dimension and final sanded the boards are packaged and ready for shipment. Plyboo flat and edge grain bamboo products are available manufactured to the California Air Resource Board (CARB) Phase II Airborne Toxic Control Measure (ATCM) 93120 regulation and the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC®) 100% label requirements. The applicable CPC Code is UN CPC 3145 - Plywood, veneer panels and similar laminated wood of bamboo.","open_xpd_uuid":"ec334h7j","resilient_flooring_thickness":null,"masonry_cement_astm_c91_type":null,"cmu_glass_powder_containing":null,"steel_rebar_diameter_min":null,"density":"1 kg /

Main Product Contents Material/Chemical Input % Wood 88.1 Additives 7.4 Moisture 4.5 Manufacturing Process Manufacturing Process MEDITE VENT is manufactured by refining softwood chips into wood fibres and combining it with resin glue and other additives. The wood fibre is then conveyed and dried by hot air through tube dryers. The dried fibre passes over a continuous weigh belt and is conveyed to fibre storage bins, ready for the next production stage. The wood fibre mat is then formed by even controlled spreading of the dried, resinated wood fibre onto a continuously moving wire mesh belt. The depth and width of wood fibre spread is pre-set according to thickness, width and density required. The mat is then compressed down to a more compact form, excess fibre is trimmed off the edges and recycled back into the wood fibre forming system. The fibre mat then moves through a continuous hot press, EPD Number: 000090 Date of Issue:02 October 2017 Expiry Date 16 December 2020 BF1805-C-ECOP Rev 0.0 Page 4 of 13 © BRE Global Ltd, 2017 which consists of an upper and lower continuously moving heated steel belt, the pressed panel is cross cut to the required length, then cooled, stacked and moved for either immediate storage or sanding.
