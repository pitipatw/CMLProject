The web-to-flanges connection is a proprietary tongue-and-groove glued joint, forming the “I” shape cross-section. For the Red-I™ I-Joist series, dimensions of top and bottom flanges range from 1-3/8” x 1-3/4” (34.9 mm x 44.5 mm) to 2-1/2” x 3-1/2” (63.5 mm x 88.9 mm), OSB web thickness range from 3/8” (9.5 mm) to 1/2” (12.7 mm), and I-Joists depths range from 9-1/2” (241 mm) to 32” (813 mm).

raw materials are sourced from Europe. The transport is exclusively by truck. Chemical mortars are usually two-component systems consisting of a binder and a hardener. One of the base components of the binder is the reactive resin which in the case of HIT-HY 200-A is produced in Kaufering. The resin production process is a chemical reaction of the corresponding educts to a basic resin with subsequent mixing of the basic resin with different reactive diluents to a reactive resin. This process is controlled and monitored by process control technology. The production of chemical mortars consists of a mixing process and a filling process of the respective single components (binder and hardener) and their subsequent union to a two-component system (container). Here as well process control technology is used to weigh and mix solid and liquid compounds according to specification. In the next step both well-mixed components run through an automized filling line in which each of the processed masses is filled into a tubular foil bag. Finally the single components are united in one container. The two-pack foil bags are packed into cardboard boxes and then finally shipped. The manufacturing plant of HIT-HY 200-A, Hilti GmbH Industriegesellschaft für Befestigungstechnik, Hiltistr. 6, 86916 Kaufering, Germany, is certified according to ISO 9001. The guideline defines international standards for quality and process management. The following flowcharts illustrate the underlying production process. Illustration: Production process of the reaction resin mixture Illustration: Production process of the packaging Declared unit: The declared product is a HILTI injection mortar HIT-HY 200 A. The declared unit refers to one kilogram of reaction resin product in the required mixing ratio of the two components. The packaging of 0,1242 kg is also included in the calculation.

raw materials are sourced from Europe. The transport is exclusively by truck. Chemical mortars are usually two-component systems consisting of a binder and a hardener. One of the base components of the binder is the reactive resin which in the case of HIT-HY 200-R is produced in Kaufering. The resin production process is a chemical reaction of the corresponding educts to a basic resin with subsequent mixing of the basic resin with different reactive diluents to a reactive resin. This process is controlled and monitored by process control technology. The production of chemical mortars consists of a mixing process and a filling process of the respective single components (binder and hardener) and their subsequent union to a two-component system (container). Here as well process control technology is used to weigh and mix solid and liquid compounds according to specification. In the next step both wellmixed components run through an automized filling line in which each of the processed masses is filled into a tubular foil bag. Finally the single components are united in one container. The two-pack foil bags are packed into cardboard boxes and then finally shipped. The manufacturing plant of HIT-HY 200-R, Hilti GmbH Industriegesellschaft für Befestigungstechnik, Hiltistr. 6, 86916 Kaufering, Germany, is certified according to ISO 9001. The guideline defines international standards for quality and process management. The following flowcharts illustrate the underlying production process. Illustration: Production process of the reaction resin mixture Illustration: Production process of the packaging Declared unit: The declared product is a HILTI injection mortar HIT-HY 200-R. The declared unit refers to one kilogram of reaction resin product in the required mixing ratio of the two components. The packaging of 0,1242 kg is also included in the calculation.

Grazie alle sue caratteristiche, anche di idrorepellenza, è ideale per la protezione e la decorazione di facciate in zone anche marine e/o esposte.

is a water-based, silicon, antibacterial, mold preventing, four season applicable matt exterior paint with lotus effect that can wash itself thanks to hydron technology. Its elasticity ensures that the capillary cracks on the surface are covered, which makes it resistant against any possible capillary crack formation on the surface. It protects surfaces against molds, fungi and mildew that may form in very moist environments. Allowing the surface to breathe, it prevents moisture from building up between interior and exterior walls and damaging both surfaces. It high water-repellency causes water droplets falling on the surface to leave the surface without being absorbed by the surface. It prevents sunlight from deforming and discoloring the paint film, assuring a longer lifetime. Its high resistance to alkalis allows it to be durable against damp weather conditions, moisture and salt water.","open_xpd_uuid":"ec3xqeg8","resilient_flooring_thickness":null,"masonry_cement_astm_c91_type":null,"cmu_glass_powder_containing":null,"steel_rebar_diameter_min":null,"density":null,"access_flooring_finish_material":null,"concrete_compressive_strength_other_d":null,"wall_base_material":null,"gwp":"2.086 kgCO2e","vrt":null,"sku":null,"asphalt_min_temperature":null,"fnd":null,"cable_trays_material":null,"pdu_outlets":null,"nsf347":null,"sog":null,"recommended_application":null,"cladding_r_value":null,"ceiling_panel_nrc":null,"plc":null,"asphalt_aggregate_size_max":null,"toughened":null,"concrete_co2_entrain":null,"thickness":null,"abuse_resistant":null,"steel_bar_elongation":null,"asphalt_gtr":null,"floor_box_cover":null,"cladding_insulating_material":null,"name":"Polisan Exelans Flat Exterior Paint","height":null,"cmu_weight_classification":null,"manufacturing_image":null,"energy_source":null,"flat_glass_panes_thickness":null,"cmu_smoothface":null,"residential_only":null,"wall_tile":null,"is_failed":false,"large_format":null,"product_usage_image_crop_area":null,"access_flooring_adjustable_height":null,"electrochromic":null,"mosaic_tile":null,"access_flooring_rolling_load_10_pass":null,"steel_composition":null,"manufacturer":{"horizontal_logo":null,"parent":null,"postal_code":"34840","primary_activity_operator":false,"email_extensions":null,"gwp_contact":null,"latitude":40.953186,"primary_activity_digitization_qa":false,"longitude":29.1174595,"my_capabilities":null,"pilot_all_employees":false,"primary_activity_design":false,"iso9001_certified":null,"primary_activity_performance_standards_issuer":false,"iso14001_certified":null,"web_domain":"polisan.com.tr","cqd_sync_server_from":null,"primary_activity_verifier":false,"address":"Küçükyalı, D100, 34840 Maltepe/İstanbul, Turkey","name":"Polisan Kansai Boya San. ve Tic.
