The result is a manufacturing facility that obtains a large portion of its energy from renewable sources and generates almost zero waste.","open_xpd_uuid":"ec3m1baw","resilient_flooring_thickness":null,"masonry_cement_astm_c91_type":null,"cmu_glass_powder_containing":null,"steel_rebar_diameter_min":null,"density":"248.2862 kg / m3","access_flooring_finish_material":null,"concrete_compressive_strength_other_d":null,"wall_base_material":null,"gwp":"1.1 kgCO2e","vrt":null,"sku":null,"asphalt_min_temperature":null,"fnd":null,"cable_trays_material":null,"pdu_outlets":null,"nsf347":null,"sog":null,"recommended_application":null,"cladding_r_value":null,"ceiling_panel_nrc":null,"plc":null,"asphalt_aggregate_size_max":null,"toughened":null,"concrete_co2_entrain":null,"thickness":null,"abuse_resistant":null,"steel_bar_elongation":null,"asphalt_gtr":null,"floor_box_cover":null,"cladding_insulating_material":null,"name":"RX SYMPHONY®m CEILING PANELS","height":null,"cmu_weight_classification":null,"manufacturing_image":null,"energy_source":null,"flat_glass_panes_thickness":null,"cmu_smoothface":null,"residential_only":null,"wall_tile":null,"is_failed":false,"large_format":null,"product_usage_image_crop_area":null,"access_flooring_adjustable_height":null,"electrochromic":null,"mosaic_tile":null,"access_flooring_rolling_load_10_pass":null,"steel_composition":null,"manufacturer":{"horizontal_logo":null,"parent":null,"postal_code":"80821","primary_activity_operator":false,"email_extensions":["certainteed.com"],"gwp_contact":null,"latitude":39.13127,"primary_activity_digitization_qa":false,"longitude":-103.46885,"my_capabilities":null,"pilot_all_employees":false,"primary_activity_design":false,"iso9001_certified":null,"primary_activity_performance_standards_issuer":false,"iso14001_certified":null,"web_domain":"certainteed.com","cqd_sync_server_from":null,"primary_activity_verifier":false,"address":"Paul Street, Hugo, CO 80821","name":"CertainTeed, Inc.

Interiors produces a family of wet felted acoustical ceiling panels at its Cloquet, MN, and Greenville, MS facilities having various light reflectance, noise reduction, and attenuation specifications with various levels of post- consumer/industrial recycled content. These production lines employ a wet felted technology in the production of acoustical ceiling panels. Wet felted acoustical ceiling panels contain mostly perlite, mineral wool, starch, recycled paper and clay. In smaller amounts, other raw materials used in the panel forming process include flocculants, biocides and defoamer. The finishing and packaging unit processes are dominated by the use of water-based paint, which contains the following ingredients: calcium carbonate, clay, latex, titanium dioxide (TiO2) and other chemicals. Shrink-wrap and corrugated strip are used as packing materials. USG Interiors, LLC also produces a family of grid products at its Westlake, OH, Cartersville, GA, Oakville, ON, Canada and Stockton, CA facilities. This family of grid products coordinates with USG Ceilings Radar ClimaPlus panels and includes 7 grid profiles including DX/DXL, DXT, DXF, DXFF and DXI. Each profile is available in Intermediate Duty and Heavy Duty weight. Grid production encompasses the third-party production of the hot-dipped galvanized steel coils, transport of these coils to USG fabrication facilities where the steel coil is cleaned, coated (optional depending on intended purpose) and slit and optionally transported to additional production facilities where the coated steel is formed into finished grid components. These finished grid components are then packaged in cardboard boxes.","open_xpd_uuid":"ec3y1c90","resilient_flooring_thickness":null,"masonry_cement_astm_c91_type":null,"cmu_glass_powder_containing":null,"steel_rebar_diameter_min":null,"density":"14

Interiors produces a family of wet felted acoustical ceiling panels at its Cloquet, MN facility having various light reflectance, noise reduction, and attenuation specifications with various levels of post-consumer/industrial recycled content. These production lines employ a wet felted technology in the production of acoustical ceiling panels. Wet felted acoustical ceiling panels contain mostly perlite, mineral wool, starch, recycled paper and clay. In smaller amounts, other raw materials used in the panel forming process include flocculants, biocides and defoamer. The finishing and packaging unit processes are dominated by the use of water-based paint, which contains the following ingredients: calcium carbonate, clay, latex, titanium dioxide (TiO2) and other chemicals. Shrink-wrap and corrugated strip are used as packing materials. USG Interiors, LLC also produces a family of grid products at its Westlake, OH, Cartersville, GA, Oakville, ON, Canada and Stockton, CA facilities. This family of grid products coordinates with USG Ceilings: Radar ClimaPlus High- Durability, Radar ClimaPlus High-CAC panels and includes 4 grid profiles including DXT, DXW and DX/DXL. Each profile is available in Intermediate Duty and Heavy Duty weight. Grid production encompasses the third-party production of the hot-dipped galvanized steel coils, transport of these coils to USG fabrication facilities where the steel coil is cleaned, coated (optional depending on intended purpose) and slit and optionally transported to additional production facilities where the coated steel is formed into finished grid components. These finished grid components are then packaged in cardboard boxes.","open_xpd_uuid":"ec3hh503","resilient_flooring_thickness":null,"masonry_cement_astm_c91_type":null,"cmu_glass_powder_containing":null,"steel_rebar_diameter_min":null,"density":"2320 kg /

Symphony m product family has a standard mineral fiber core with a reinforced mat and finish coatings. This Environmental Product Declaration (EPD) examines the ¾” thickness mineral fiber core product. The coatings modeled include the back, primer, edge and top coatings that are specific for the Symphony m product line.  These products are manufactured using mineral fibers with pre-consumer recycled content of at least 54%.  This EPD is specific to the Symphony m Ceiling Panel products manufactured at the Plymouth, WI facility. The mineral fiber core is produced at the CertainTeed Ceilings L’Anse, MI facility and then shipped to Plymouth for the final finishing of the production. The L’Anse manufacturing facility is a model of industrial ecology and product stewardship. The facility receives renewable electricity from the neighboring Warden Electric Biomass power plant, which generates its electricity from waste wood. Excess steam from that same power plant is also channeled to the L’Anse manufacturing facility, reducing the plant’s overall natural gas consumption. The result is a manufacturing facility that obtains a large portion of its energy from renewable sources and generates almost zero waste.","open_xpd_uuid":"ec3j45s1","resilient_flooring_thickness":null,"masonry_cement_astm_c91_type":null,"cmu_glass_powder_containing":null,"steel_rebar_diameter_min":null,"density":"248.2862 kg / m3","access_flooring_finish_material":null,"concrete_compressive_strength_other_d":null,"wall_base_material":null,"gwp":"1.1 kgCO2e","vrt":null,"sku":null,"asphalt_min_temperature":null,"fnd":null,"cable_trays_material":null,"pdu_outlets":null,"nsf347":null,"sog":null,"recommended_application":null,"cladding_r_value":null,"ceiling_panel_nrc":null,"plc":null,"asphalt_aggregate_size_max":null,"toughened":null,"concrete_co2_entrain":null,"thickness":null,"abuse_resistant":null,"steel_bar_elongation":null,"asphalt_gtr":null,"floor_box_cover":null,"cladding_insulating_material":null,"name":"SYMPHONY®m CEILING PANELS","height":null,"cmu_weight_classification":null,"manufacturing_image":null,"energy_source":null,"flat_glass_panes_thickness":null,"cmu_smoothface":null,"residential_only":null,"wall_tile":null,"is_failed":false,"large_format":null,"product_usage_image_crop_area":null,"access_flooring_adjustable_height":null,"electrochromic":null,"mosaic_tile":null,"access_flooring_rolling_load_10_pass":null,"steel_composition":null,"manufacturer":{"horizontal_logo":null,"parent":null,"postal_code":"80821","primary_activity_operator":false,"email_extensions":["certainteed.com"],"gwp_contact":null,"latitude":39.13127,"primary_activity_digitization_qa":false,"longitude":-103.46885,"my_capabilities":null,"pilot_all_employees":false,"primary_activity_design":false,"iso9001_certified":null,"primary_activity_performance_standards_issuer":false,"iso14001_certified":null,"web_domain":"certainteed.com","cqd_sync_server_from":null,"primary_activity_verifier":false,"address":"Paul Street, Hugo, CO 80821","name":"CertainTeed, Inc.

The coatings modeled include the back, primer, edge and top coatings that are specific for the Symphony m product line. These products are manufactured using mineral fibers with pre- Excellent sound absorption and consumer recycled content of at least 54%. attenuation Exceptional surface durability: scratch / sag / and mold resistant This EPD is specific to the Symphony m Ceiling Panel products manufactured at the Plymouth, WI facility. The mineral fiber core is Chemically cleanable surface to a produced at the CertainTeed Ceilings L’Anse, MI facility and then range of 1000-2000 wash cycles shipped to Plymouth for the final finishing of the production. The L’Anse manufacturing facility is a model of industrial ecology and High light reflectancy (LR 0.90) product stewardship. The facility receives renewable electricity from USDA certified bio-based content of the neighboring Warden Electric Biomass power plant, which 98% generates its electricity from waste wood. Excess steam from that same power plant is also channeled to the L’Anse manufacturing Meets LEED v4 VOC compliance facility, reducing the plant’s overall natural gas consumption. The result is a manufacturing facility that obtains a large portion of its ISO Class 4 clean room component energy from renewable sources and generates almost zero waste.

The production site of Saint-Gobain Ecophon (Sweden) produces acoustic ceilings and wall absorbers based on glass wool with a plant based binder in different densities and thicknesses. The glass wool is covered with a painted or woven surface layer and cut into panels of different sizes and edge designs. The edges are painted and the panels are packed in cardboard boxes. The structure of glass wool gives the material excellent sound energy absorption properties. Sound absorption is the main function of acoustic glass wool panels. The panels are also light, stable, and easy to handle and cut. Acoustic glass wool panels are commonly used in schools, offices, health care facilities and production premises where there is a need for noise reduction to improve the working environment. The decrease in reverberation time, sound pressure level and other acoustic parameters are related to the amount of panels used in the room as well as the placement of the panels. The acoustic panels need no maintenance and do not age. They can last as long as the building itself. For aesthetic reasons, normal room surface cleaning is advised.

In addition to that, the perforation and lining of metal ceilings contribute to sound absorption in order to create acoustic comfort. Gabelex ceilings can be fully recycled at end of life.

600 consist of powder coated steel tile/raft with acoustic insert, made from various combinations and thicknesses of acoustic facings, insulation layers bonded together with adhesive. Standard lengths from 300mm to 3000mm, and width are between 300 mm and 1200mm, however bespoke size are available on request. System 600 can be plain or perforated to meet acoustic and client requirements. The system offers a variety of applications from the purely aesthetic to high performance acoustics with service integration. The rafts and modules are available in a range of curved, flat or angled profiles as standard. Bespoke designs can be achieved to realise highly aspirational interiors.

The production site of Saint-Gobain Ecophon (Sweden) produces acoustic ceilings and wall absorbers based on glass wool with a plant based binder in different densities and thicknesses. The glass wool is covered with a painted or woven surface layer and cut into panels of different sizes and edge designs. The edges are painted and the panels are packed in cardboard boxes. The structure of glass wool gives the material excellent sound energy absorption properties. Sound absorption is the main function of acoustic glass wool panels. The panels are also light, stable, and easy to handle and cut. Acoustic glass wool panels are commonly used in schools, offices, health care facilities and production premises where there is a need for noise reduction to improve the working environment. The decrease in reverberation time, sound pressure level and other acoustic parameters are related to the amount of panels used in the room as well as the placement of the panels. The acoustic panels need no maintenance and do not age. They can last as long as the building itself. For aesthetic reasons, normal room surface cleaning is advised.","open_xpd_uuid":"ec3420j3","resilient_flooring_thickness":null,"masonry_cement_astm_c91_type":null,"cmu_glass_powder_containing":null,"steel_rebar_diameter_min":null,"density":"2320 kg /

The production site of Saint-Gobain Ecophon (Sweden) produces acoustic ceilings and wall absorbers based on glass wool with a plant based binder in different densities and thicknesses. The glass wool is covered with a painted or woven surface layer and cut into panels of different sizes and edge designs. The edges are painted and the panels are packed in cardboard boxes. The structure of glass wool gives the material excellent sound energy absorption properties. Sound absorption is the main function of acoustic glass wool panels. The panels are also light, stable, and easy to handle and cut. Acoustic glass wool panels are commonly used in schools, offices, health care facilities and production premises where there is a need for noise reduction to improve the working environment. The decrease in reverberation time, sound pressure level and other acoustic parameters are related to the amount of panels used in the room as well as the placement of the panels. The acoustic panels need no maintenance and do not age. They can last as long as the building itself. For aesthetic reasons, normal room surface cleaning is advised.

The production site of Saint-Gobain Ecophon (Sweden) produces acoustic ceilings and wall absorbers based on glass wool with a plant based binder in different densities and thicknesses. The glass wool is covered with a painted or woven surface layer and cut into panels of different sizes and edge designs. The edges are painted and the panels are packed in cardboard boxes. The structure of glass wool gives the material excellent sound energy absorption properties. Sound absorption is the main function of acoustic glass wool panels. The panels are also light, stable, and easy to handle and cut. Acoustic glass wool panels are commonly used in schools, offices, health care facilities and production premises where there is a need for noise reduction to improve the working environment. The decrease in reverberation time, sound pressure level and other acoustic parameters are related to the amount of panels used in the room as well as the placement of the panels. The acoustic panels need no maintenance and do not age. They can last as long as the building itself. For aesthetic reasons, normal room surface cleaning is advised.","open_xpd_uuid":"ec38fgxp","resilient_flooring_thickness":null,"masonry_cement_astm_c91_type":null,"cmu_glass_powder_containing":null,"steel_rebar_diameter_min":null,"density":"2320 kg /

Environmental Product Declaration (EPD) for the Solo product family describes the environmental impact of 1m² of acoustic ceiling with the intended use to increase sound absorption in a room to create a better indoor environment. The scope for this EPD is cradle-to-grave.The production site of Saint-Gobain Ecophon (Sweden) produces acoustic ceilings and wall absorbers based on glass wool with a plant based binder in different densities and thicknesses. The glass wool is covered with a painted or woven surface layer and cut into panels of different sizes and edge designs.Acoustic panels made of glass wool are commonly used in schools, offices, health care facilities and production premises where there is a need for noise reduction to improve the working environment. The decrease in reverberation time, sound pressure level and other acoustic parameters are related to the amount of panels used in the room as well as the placement of the panels.","open_xpd_uuid":"ec3sxuqx","resilient_flooring_thickness":null,"masonry_cement_astm_c91_type":null,"cmu_glass_powder_containing":null,"steel_rebar_diameter_min":null,"density":"2320

Environmental Product Declaration (EPD) for the Advantage product family describes the environmental impact of 1m² of acoustic ceiling with the intended use to increase sound absorption in a room to create a better indoor environment. The scope for this EPD is cradle-to-grave.The production site of Saint-Gobain Ecophon (Sweden) produces acoustic ceilings and wall absorbers based on glass wool with a plant based binder in different densities and thicknesses. The glass wool is covered with a painted or woven surface layer and cut into panels of different sizes and edge designs.Acoustic panels made of glass wool are commonly used in schools, offices, health care facilities and production premises where there is a need for noise reduction to improve the working environment. The decrease in reverberation time, sound pressure level and other acoustic parameters are related to the amount of panels used in the room as well as the placement of the panels.","open_xpd_uuid":"ec39ptez","resilient_flooring_thickness":null,"masonry_cement_astm_c91_type":null,"cmu_glass_powder_containing":null,"steel_rebar_diameter_min":null,"density":"2320 kg /

Environmental Product Declaration (EPD) for the Hygiene product family describes the environmental impact of 1m² of acoustic ceiling with the intended use to increase sound absorption in a room to create a better indoor environment. The scope for this EPD is cradle-to-grave.The production site of Saint-Gobain Ecophon (Sweden) produces acoustic ceilings and wall absorbers based on glass wool with a plant based binder in different densities and thicknesses. The glass wool is covered with a painted or woven surface layer and cut into panels of different sizes and edge designs.Acoustic panels made of glass wool are commonly used in schools, offices, health care facilities and production premises where there is a need for noise reduction to improve the working environment. The decrease in reverberation time, sound pressure level and other acoustic parameters are related to the amount of panels used in the room as well as the placement of the panels.","open_xpd_uuid":"ec35smne","resilient_flooring_thickness":null,"masonry_cement_astm_c91_type":null,"cmu_glass_powder_containing":null,"steel_rebar_diameter_min":null,"density":"2320

600 consist of powder coated steel tile/raft with acoustic insert, made from various combinations and thicknesses of acoustic facings, insulation layers bonded together with adhesive. Standard lengths from 300mm to 3000mm, and width are between 300 mm and 1200mm, however bespoke size are available on request. System 600 can be plain or perforated to meet acoustic and client requirements. The system offers a variety of applications from the purely aesthetic to high performance acoustics with service integration. The rafts and modules are available in a range of curved, flat or angled profiles as standard. Bespoke designs can be achieved to realise highly aspirational interiors. The flexibility of System 600 rafts and tile modules makes them ideal for both new build and retrofit acoustic

Environmental Product Declaration (EPD) for the Master product family describes the environmental impact of 1m² of acoustic ceiling with the intended use to increase sound absorption in a room to create a better indoor environment. The scope for this EPD is cradle-to-grave.The production site of Saint-Gobain Ecophon (Sweden) produces acoustic ceilings and wall absorbers based on glass wool with a plant based binder in different densities and thicknesses. The glass wool is covered with a painted or woven surface layer and cut into panels of different sizes and edge designs.Acoustic panels made of glass wool are commonly used in schools, offices, health care facilities and production premises where there is a need for noise reduction to improve the working environment. The decrease in reverberation time, sound pressure level and other acoustic parameters are related to the amount of panels used in the room as well as the placement of the panels.","open_xpd_uuid":"ec37bmpu","resilient_flooring_thickness":null,"masonry_cement_astm_c91_type":null,"cmu_glass_powder_containing":null,"steel_rebar_diameter_min":null,"density":"69.75 kg /

Wet-felted acoustical ceiling panels contain mostly perlite, mineral wool, starch, recycled paper and clay. In smaller amounts, other raw materials used in the panel forming process include flocculants, biocides and defoamer. The finishing and packaging unit processes are dominated by the use of water-based paint, which contains the following ingredients: calcium carbonate, clay, latex, titanium dioxide (Ti02) and other chemicals. Shrink-wrap and corrugated strip are used as packing materials. USG Interiors, LLC also produces a family of grid products at its Westlake, OH, Cartersville, GA, Oakville, ON, Canada and Stockton, CA facilities. This family of grid products coordinates with USG Ceilings Radar panels and includes 7 grid profiles including DX/DXL, DXW, DXT, DXF, DXFF and DXI. Each profile is available in Intermediate Duty and Heavy Duty weight. Grid production encompasses the third-party production of the hot-dipped galvanized steel coils, transport of these coils to USG fabrication facilities where the steel coil is cleaned, coated (optional depending on intended purpose) and slit and optionally transported to additional production facilities where the coated steel is formed into finished grid components. These finished grid components are then packaged in cardboard boxes.","open_xpd_uuid":"ec3u2mhe","resilient_flooring_thickness":null,"masonry_cement_astm_c91_type":null,"cmu_glass_powder_containing":null,"steel_rebar_diameter_min":null,"density":"14
