is produced by mixing stones of various sizes with bitumen or modified bitumen in a mixer. Sand is often added and sometimes special additives are included to achieve desirable properties  in the asphalt mix. Used asphalt is one of the most recycled materials in the world and can be used at many production facilities. Some production facilities also incorporate recycled glass, plastic, printer toner, steel slag and rubber to produce sustainable mixes designed to meet client performance requirements. When required, oxides to colour asphalt, cellulose fibre and several other additives can be fed into the production process to achieve structural, functional or architectural

is produced by mixing stones of various sizes with bitumen or modified bitumen in a mixer. Sand is often added and sometimes special additives are included to achieve desirable properties  in the asphalt mix. Used asphalt is one of the most recycled materials in the world and can be used at many production facilities. Some production facilities also incorporate recycled glass, plastic, printer toner, steel slag and rubber to produce sustainable mixes designed to meet client performance requirements. When required, oxides to colour asphalt, cellulose fibre and several other additives can be fed into the production process to achieve structural, functional or architectural

is produced by mixing stones of various sizes with bitumen or modified bitumen in a mixer.

Used asphalt is one of the most recycled materials in the world and can be used at many production facilities. Some production facilities also incorporate recycled glass, plastic, printer toner, steel slag and rubber to produce sustainable mixes designed to meet client performance requirements. When required, oxides to colour asphalt, cellulose fibre and several other additives can be fed into the production process to achieve structural, functional or architectural

is produced by mixing stones of various sizes with bitumen or modified bitumen in a mixer. Sand is often added and sometimes special additives are included to achieve desirable properties  in the asphalt mix. Used asphalt is one of the most recycled materials in the world and can be used at many production facilities. Some production facilities also incorporate recycled glass, plastic, printer toner, steel slag and rubber to produce sustainable mixes designed to meet client performance requirements. When required, oxides to colour asphalt, cellulose fibre and several other additives can be fed into the production process to achieve structural, functional or architectural

is produced by mixing stones of various sizes with bitumen or modified bitumen in a mixer. Sand is often added and sometimes special additives are included to achieve desirable properties  in the asphalt mix. Used asphalt is one of the most recycled materials in the world and can be used at many production facilities. Some production facilities also incorporate recycled glass, plastic, printer toner, steel slag and rubber to produce sustainable mixes designed to meet client performance requirements. When required, oxides to colour asphalt, cellulose fibre and several other additives can be fed into the production process to achieve structural, functional or architectural

is produced by mixing stones of various sizes with bitumen or modified bitumen in a mixer. Sand is often added and sometimes special additives are included to achieve desirable properties  in the asphalt mix. Used asphalt is one of the most recycled materials in the world and can be used at many production facilities. Some production facilities also incorporate recycled glass, plastic, printer toner, steel slag and rubber to produce sustainable mixes designed to meet client performance requirements. When required, oxides to colour asphalt, cellulose fibre and several other additives can be fed into the production process to achieve structural, functional or architectural

is produced by mixing stones of various sizes with bitumen or modified bitumen in a mixer. Sand is often added and sometimes special additives are included to achieve desirable properties  in the asphalt mix. Used asphalt is one of the most recycled materials in the world and can be used at many production facilities. Some production facilities also incorporate recycled glass, plastic, printer toner, steel slag and rubber to produce sustainable mixes designed to meet client performance requirements. When required, oxides to colour asphalt, cellulose fibre and several other additives can be fed into the production process to achieve structural, functional or architectural attributes.","open_xpd_uuid":"ec3zt8m9","resilient_flooring_thickness":null,"masonry_cement_astm_c91_type":null,"cmu_glass_powder_containing":null,"steel_rebar_diameter_min":null,"density":"2400 kg /

products included in this EPD are asphalt mixtures distributed by Asfaltsgruppen Öst AB from production plants in Normstorp and Vagnhärad, Sweden. The asphalt mixtures consist mainly of coarse and fine aggregates, bitumen and filler in various grades depending on application.\nABb is usually used as an intermediate layer between the base layer of asphalt and the top layer. On roads with a high proportion of heavy traffic, it provides high stability and durability. \nABD isused as a second layer on roads where noise and hydroplaning is a problem. Both the noice reduction effect and the draining capacity decreases quite quickly over time, which is why such surfaces need to be re-laid more often to maintain the function.\nABS isused as the top layer on medium and high traffic roads. It provides durable roads that are not deformed and can withstand hard loads. Rainwater can be drained away into the coarse structure that the mixture forms.\nABT could be used for everything from garage driveways to low-and medium traffic roads and streets. The mixture does not have as high resistance to deformation as other asphalt mixtures and istherefor not used on roads with heavy traffic. \nABÖ is a top layer with open structure that can be used for sludged pavings or as base layer for running tracks.\nAG is often used as the base layer on roads. It could be used on all types of roads and surfaces. It can also be advantageously laid out in thick layers.\nAGF is often used as the base layer on roads and can also be used as a top layer. It could be used on all types of roads and surfaces. It can also be advantageously laid out in thick layers. The AGF mixture has a higher binder content then the AG mixture to cope better with wear andhave a longer service life.","open_xpd_uuid":"ec3hhnq2","resilient_flooring_thickness":null,"masonry_cement_astm_c91_type":null,"cmu_glass_powder_containing":null,"steel_rebar_diameter_min":null,"density":"2400 kg /

products included in this EPD are asphalt mixtures distributed by Asfaltsgruppen Öst AB from production plants in Normstorp and Vagnhärad, Sweden. The asphalt mixtures consist mainly of coarse and fine aggregates, bitumen and filler in various grades depending on application.\nABb is usually used as an intermediate layer between the base layer of asphalt and the top layer. On roads with a high proportion of heavy traffic, it provides high stability and durability. \nABD isused as a second layer on roads where noise and hydroplaning is a problem. Both the noice reduction effect and the draining capacity decreases quite quickly over time, which is why such surfaces need to be re-laid more often to maintain the function.\nABS isused as the top layer on medium and high traffic roads. It provides durable roads that are not deformed and can withstand hard loads. Rainwater can be drained away into the coarse structure that the mixture forms.\nABT could be used for everything from garage driveways to low-and medium traffic roads and streets. The mixture does not have as high resistance to deformation as other asphalt mixtures and istherefor not used on roads with heavy traffic. \nABÖ is a top layer with open structure that can be used for sludged pavings or as base layer for running tracks.\nAG is often used as the base layer on roads. It could be used on all types of roads and surfaces. It can also be advantageously laid out in thick layers.\nAGF is often used as the base layer on roads and can also be used as a top layer. It could be used on all types of roads and surfaces. It can also be advantageously laid out in thick layers. The AGF mixture has a higher binder content then the AG mixture to cope better with wear andhave a longer service life.","open_xpd_uuid":"ec37je8n","resilient_flooring_thickness":null,"masonry_cement_astm_c91_type":null,"cmu_glass_powder_containing":null,"steel_rebar_diameter_min":null,"density":"2400 kg /

products included in this EPD are asphalt mixtures distributed by Asfaltsgruppen Öst AB from production plants in Normstorp and Vagnhärad, Sweden. The asphalt mixtures consist mainly of coarse and fine aggregates, bitumen and filler in various grades depending on application.\nABb is usually used as an intermediate layer between the base layer of asphalt and the top layer. On roads with a high proportion of heavy traffic, it provides high stability and durability. \nABD isused as a second layer on roads where noise and hydroplaning is a problem. Both the noice reduction effect and the draining capacity decreases quite quickly over time, which is why such surfaces need to be re-laid more often to maintain the function.\nABS isused as the top layer on medium and high traffic roads. It provides durable roads that are not deformed and can withstand hard loads. Rainwater can be drained away into the coarse structure that the mixture forms.\nABT could be used for everything from garage driveways to low-and medium traffic roads and streets. The mixture does not have as high resistance to deformation as other asphalt mixtures and istherefor not used on roads with heavy traffic. \nABÖ is a top layer with open structure that can be used for sludged pavings or as base layer for running tracks.\nAG is often used as the base layer on roads. It could be used on all types of roads and surfaces. It can also be advantageously laid out in thick layers.\nAGF is often used as the base layer on roads and can also be used as a top layer. It could be used on all types of roads and surfaces. It can also be advantageously laid out in thick layers. The AGF mixture has a higher binder content then the AG mixture to cope better with wear andhave a longer service

products included in this EPD are asphalt mixtures distributed by Asfaltsgruppen Öst AB from production plants in Normstorp and Vagnhärad, Sweden. The asphalt mixtures consist mainly of coarse and fine aggregates, bitumen and filler in various grades depending on application.\nABb is usually used as an intermediate layer between the base layer of asphalt and the top layer. On roads with a high proportion of heavy traffic, it provides high stability and durability. \nABD isused as a second layer on roads where noise and hydroplaning is a problem. Both the noice reduction effect and the draining capacity decreases quite quickly over time, which is why such surfaces need to be re-laid more often to maintain the function.\nABS isused as the top layer on medium and high traffic roads. It provides durable roads that are not deformed and can withstand hard loads. Rainwater can be drained away into the coarse structure that the mixture forms.\nABT could be used for everything from garage driveways to low-and medium traffic roads and streets. The mixture does not have as high resistance to deformation as other asphalt mixtures and istherefor not used on roads with heavy traffic. \nABÖ is a top layer with open structure that can be used for sludged pavings or as base layer for running tracks.\nAG is often used as the base layer on roads. It could be used on all types of roads and surfaces. It can also be advantageously laid out in thick layers.\nAGF is often used as the base layer on roads and can also be used as a top layer. It could be used on all types of roads and surfaces. It can also be advantageously laid out in thick layers. The AGF mixture has a higher binder content then the AG mixture to cope better with wear andhave a longer service life.","open_xpd_uuid":"ec3pnr7h","resilient_flooring_thickness":null,"masonry_cement_astm_c91_type":null,"cmu_glass_powder_containing":null,"steel_rebar_diameter_min":null,"density":"2400 kg /

products included in this EPD are asphalt mixtures distributed by Asfaltsgruppen Öst AB from production plants in Normstorp and Vagnhärad, Sweden. The asphalt mixtures consist mainly of coarse and fine aggregates, bitumen and filler in various grades depending on application.\nABb is usually used as an intermediate layer between the base layer of asphalt and the top layer. On roads with a high proportion of heavy traffic, it provides high stability and durability. \nABD isused as a second layer on roads where noise and hydroplaning is a problem. Both the noice reduction effect and the draining capacity decreases quite quickly over time, which is why such surfaces need to be re-laid more often to maintain the function.\nABS isused as the top layer on medium and high traffic roads. It provides durable roads that are not deformed and can withstand hard loads. Rainwater can be drained away into the coarse structure that the mixture forms.\nABT could be used for everything from garage driveways to low-and medium traffic roads and streets. The mixture does not have as high resistance to deformation as other asphalt mixtures and istherefor not used on roads with heavy traffic. \nABÖ is a top layer with open structure that can be used for sludged pavings or as base layer for running tracks.\nAG is often used as the base layer on roads. It could be used on all types of roads and surfaces. It can also be advantageously laid out in thick layers.\nAGF is often used as the base layer on roads and can also be used as a top layer. It could be used on all types of roads and surfaces. It can also be advantageously laid out in thick layers. The AGF mixture has a higher binder content then the AG mixture to cope better with wear andhave a longer service life.","open_xpd_uuid":"ec32pu38","resilient_flooring_thickness":null,"masonry_cement_astm_c91_type":null,"cmu_glass_powder_containing":null,"steel_rebar_diameter_min":null,"density":"2400 kg /

products included in this EPD are asphalt mixtures distributed by Asfaltsgruppen Öst AB from production plants in Normstorp and Vagnhärad, Sweden. The asphalt mixtures consist mainly of coarse and fine aggregates, bitumen and filler in various grades depending on application.\nABb is usually used as an intermediate layer between the base layer of asphalt and the top layer. On roads with a high proportion of heavy traffic, it provides high stability and durability. \nABD isused as a second layer on roads where noise and hydroplaning is a problem. Both the noice reduction effect and the draining capacity decreases quite quickly over time, which is why such surfaces need to be re-laid more often to maintain the function.\nABS isused as the top layer on medium and high traffic roads. It provides durable roads that are not deformed and can withstand hard loads. Rainwater can be drained away into the coarse structure that the mixture forms.\nABT could be used for everything from garage driveways to low-and medium traffic roads and streets. The mixture does not have as high resistance to deformation as other asphalt mixtures and istherefor not used on roads with heavy traffic. \nABÖ is a top layer with open structure that can be used for sludged pavings or as base layer for running tracks.\nAG is often used as the base layer on roads. It could be used on all types of roads and surfaces. It can also be advantageously laid out in thick layers.\nAGF is often used as the base layer on roads and can also be used as a top layer. It could be used on all types of roads and surfaces. It can also be advantageously laid out in thick layers. The AGF mixture has a higher binder content then the AG mixture to cope better with wear andhave a longer service

products included in this EPD are asphalt mixtures distributed by Asfaltsgruppen Öst AB from production plants in Normstorp and Vagnhärad, Sweden. The asphalt mixtures consist mainly of coarse and fine aggregates, bitumen and filler in various grades depending on application.\nABb is usually used as an intermediate layer between the base layer of asphalt and the top layer. On roads with a high proportion of heavy traffic, it provides high stability and durability. \nABD isused as a second layer on roads where noise and hydroplaning is a problem. Both the noice reduction effect and the draining capacity decreases quite quickly over time, which is why such surfaces need to be re-laid more often to maintain the function.\nABS isused as the top layer on medium and high traffic roads. It provides durable roads that are not deformed and can withstand hard loads. Rainwater can be drained away into the coarse structure that the mixture forms.\nABT could be used for everything from garage driveways to low-and medium traffic roads and streets. The mixture does not have as high resistance to deformation as other asphalt mixtures and istherefor not used on roads with heavy traffic. \nABÖ is a top layer with open structure that can be used for sludged pavings or as base layer for running tracks.\nAG is often used as the base layer on roads. It could be used on all types of roads and surfaces. It can also be advantageously laid out in thick layers.\nAGF is often used as the base layer on roads and can also be used as a top layer. It could be used on all types of roads and surfaces. It can also be advantageously laid out in thick layers. The AGF mixture has a higher binder content then the AG mixture to cope better with wear andhave a longer service life.","open_xpd_uuid":"ec3hb4gp","resilient_flooring_thickness":null,"masonry_cement_astm_c91_type":null,"cmu_glass_powder_containing":null,"steel_rebar_diameter_min":null,"density":"2400 kg /

products included in this EPD are asphalt mixtures distributed by Asfaltsgruppen Öst AB from production plants in Normstorp and Vagnhärad, Sweden. The asphalt mixtures consist mainly of coarse and fine aggregates, bitumen and filler in various grades depending on application.\nABb is usually used as an intermediate layer between the base layer of asphalt and the top layer. On roads with a high proportion of heavy traffic, it provides high stability and durability. \nABD isused as a second layer on roads where noise and hydroplaning is a problem. Both the noice reduction effect and the draining capacity decreases quite quickly over time, which is why such surfaces need to be re-laid more often to maintain the function.\nABS isused as the top layer on medium and high traffic roads. It provides durable roads that are not deformed and can withstand hard loads. Rainwater can be drained away into the coarse structure that the mixture forms.\nABT could be used for everything from garage driveways to low-and medium traffic roads and streets. The mixture does not have as high resistance to deformation as other asphalt mixtures and istherefor not used on roads with heavy traffic. \nABÖ is a top layer with open structure that can be used for sludged pavings or as base layer for running tracks.\nAG is often used as the base layer on roads. It could be used on all types of roads and surfaces. It can also be advantageously laid out in thick layers.\nAGF is often used as the base layer on roads and can also be used as a top layer. It could be used on all types of roads and surfaces. It can also be advantageously laid out in thick layers. The AGF mixture has a higher binder content then the AG mixture to cope better with wear andhave a longer service life.","open_xpd_uuid":"ec39y3gj","resilient_flooring_thickness":null,"masonry_cement_astm_c91_type":null,"cmu_glass_powder_containing":null,"steel_rebar_diameter_min":null,"density":"2400 kg /

products included in this EPD are asphalt mixtures distributed by Asfaltsgruppen Öst AB from production plants in Normstorp and Vagnhärad, Sweden. The asphalt mixtures consist mainly of coarse and fine aggregates, bitumen and filler in various grades depending on application.\nABb is usually used as an intermediate layer between the base layer of asphalt and the top layer. On roads with a high proportion of heavy traffic, it provides high stability and durability. \nABD isused as a second layer on roads where noise and hydroplaning is a problem. Both the noice reduction effect and the draining capacity decreases quite quickly over time, which is why such surfaces need to be re-laid more often to maintain the function.\nABS isused as the top layer on medium and high traffic roads. It provides durable roads that are not deformed and can withstand hard loads. Rainwater can be drained away into the coarse structure that the mixture forms.\nABT could be used for everything from garage driveways to low-and medium traffic roads and streets. The mixture does not have as high resistance to deformation as other asphalt mixtures and istherefor not used on roads with heavy traffic. \nABÖ is a top layer with open structure that can be used for sludged pavings or as base layer for running tracks.\nAG is often used as the base layer on roads. It could be used on all types of roads and surfaces. It can also be advantageously laid out in thick layers.\nAGF is often used as the base layer on roads and can also be used as a top layer. It could be used on all types of roads and surfaces. It can also be advantageously laid out in thick layers. The AGF mixture has a higher binder content then the AG mixture to cope better with wear andhave a longer service

products included in this EPD are asphalt mixtures distributed by Asfaltsgruppen Öst AB from production plants in Normstorp and Vagnhärad, Sweden. The asphalt mixtures consist mainly of coarse and fine aggregates, bitumen and filler in various grades depending on application.\nABb is usually used as an intermediate layer between the base layer of asphalt and the top layer. On roads with a high proportion of heavy traffic, it provides high stability and durability. \nABD isused as a second layer on roads where noise and hydroplaning is a problem. Both the noice reduction effect and the draining capacity decreases quite quickly over time, which is why such surfaces need to be re-laid more often to maintain the function.\nABS isused as the top layer on medium and high traffic roads. It provides durable roads that are not deformed and can withstand hard loads. Rainwater can be drained away into the coarse structure that the mixture forms.\nABT could be used for everything from garage driveways to low-and medium traffic roads and streets. The mixture does not have as high resistance to deformation as other asphalt mixtures and istherefor not used on roads with heavy traffic. \nABÖ is a top layer with open structure that can be used for sludged pavings or as base layer for running tracks.\nAG is often used as the base layer on roads. It could be used on all types of roads and surfaces. It can also be advantageously laid out in thick layers.\nAGF is often used as the base layer on roads and can also be used as a top layer. It could be used on all types of roads and surfaces. It can also be advantageously laid out in thick layers. The AGF mixture has a higher binder content then the AG mixture to cope better with wear andhave a longer service life.","open_xpd_uuid":"ec37qga8","resilient_flooring_thickness":null,"masonry_cement_astm_c91_type":null,"cmu_glass_powder_containing":null,"steel_rebar_diameter_min":null,"density":"2400 kg /

Both the noice reduction effect and the draining capacity decreases quite quickly over time, which is why such surfaces need to be re-laid more often to maintain the function.\nABS isused as the top layer on medium and high traffic roads. It provides durable roads that are not deformed and can withstand hard loads. Rainwater can be drained away into the coarse structure that the mixture forms.\nABT could be used for everything from garage driveways to low-and medium traffic roads and streets. The mixture does not have as high resistance to deformation as other asphalt mixtures and istherefor not used on roads with heavy traffic. \nABÖ is a top layer with open structure that can be used for sludged pavings or as base layer for running tracks.\nAG is often used as the base layer on roads.

The AGF mixture has a higher binder content then the AG mixture to cope better with wear andhave a longer service

products included in this EPD are asphalt mixtures distributed by Asfaltsgruppen Öst AB from production plants in Normstorp and Vagnhärad, Sweden. The asphalt mixtures consist mainly of coarse and fine aggregates, bitumen and filler in various grades depending on application.\nABb is usually used as an intermediate layer between the base layer of asphalt and the top layer. On roads with a high proportion of heavy traffic, it provides high stability and durability. \nABD isused as a second layer on roads where noise and hydroplaning is a problem. Both the noice reduction effect and the draining capacity decreases quite quickly over time, which is why such surfaces need to be re-laid more often to maintain the function.\nABS isused as the top layer on medium and high traffic roads. It provides durable roads that are not deformed and can withstand hard loads. Rainwater can be drained away into the coarse structure that the mixture forms.\nABT could be used for everything from garage driveways to low-and medium traffic roads and streets. The mixture does not have as high resistance to deformation as other asphalt mixtures and istherefor not used on roads with heavy traffic. \nABÖ is a top layer with open structure that can be used for sludged pavings or as base layer for running tracks.\nAG is often used as the base layer on roads. It could be used on all types of roads and surfaces. It can also be advantageously laid out in thick layers.\nAGF is often used as the base layer on roads and can also be used as a top layer. It could be used on all types of roads and surfaces. It can also be advantageously laid out in thick layers. The AGF mixture has a higher binder content then the AG mixture to cope better with wear andhave a longer service

products included in this EPD are asphalt mixtures distributed by Asfaltsgruppen Öst AB from production plants in Normstorp and Vagnhärad, Sweden. The asphalt mixtures consist mainly of coarse and fine aggregates, bitumen and filler in various grades depending on application.\nABb is usually used as an intermediate layer between the base layer of asphalt and the top layer. On roads with a high proportion of heavy traffic, it provides high stability and durability. \nABD isused as a second layer on roads where noise and hydroplaning is a problem. Both the noice reduction effect and the draining capacity decreases quite quickly over time, which is why such surfaces need to be re-laid more often to maintain the function.\nABS isused as the top layer on medium and high traffic roads. It provides durable roads that are not deformed and can withstand hard loads. Rainwater can be drained away into the coarse structure that the mixture forms.\nABT could be used for everything from garage driveways to low-and medium traffic roads and streets. The mixture does not have as high resistance to deformation as other asphalt mixtures and istherefor not used on roads with heavy traffic. \nABÖ is a top layer with open structure that can be used for sludged pavings or as base layer for running tracks.\nAG is often used as the base layer on roads. It could be used on all types of roads and surfaces. It can also be advantageously laid out in thick layers.\nAGF is often used as the base layer on roads and can also be used as a top layer. It could be used on all types of roads and surfaces. It can also be advantageously laid out in thick layers. The AGF mixture has a higher binder content then the AG mixture to cope better with wear andhave a longer service life.","open_xpd_uuid":"ec32k9sp","resilient_flooring_thickness":null,"masonry_cement_astm_c91_type":null,"cmu_glass_powder_containing":null,"steel_rebar_diameter_min":null,"density":"2400 kg /

products included in this EPD are asphalt mixtures distributed by Asfaltsgruppen Öst AB from production plants in Normstorp and Vagnhärad, Sweden. The asphalt mixtures consist mainly of coarse and fine aggregates, bitumen and filler in various grades depending on application.\nABb is usually used as an intermediate layer between the base layer of asphalt and the top layer. On roads with a high proportion of heavy traffic, it provides high stability and durability. \nABD isused as a second layer on roads where noise and hydroplaning is a problem. Both the noice reduction effect and the draining capacity decreases quite quickly over time, which is why such surfaces need to be re-laid more often to maintain the function.\nABS isused as the top layer on medium and high traffic roads. It provides durable roads that are not deformed and can withstand hard loads. Rainwater can be drained away into the coarse structure that the mixture forms.\nABT could be used for everything from garage driveways to low-and medium traffic roads and streets. The mixture does not have as high resistance to deformation as other asphalt mixtures and istherefor not used on roads with heavy traffic. \nABÖ is a top layer with open structure that can be used for sludged pavings or as base layer for running tracks.\nAG is often used as the base layer on roads. It could be used on all types of roads and surfaces. It can also be advantageously laid out in thick layers.\nAGF is often used as the base layer on roads and can also be used as a top layer. It could be used on all types of roads and surfaces. It can also be advantageously laid out in thick layers. The AGF mixture has a higher binder content then the AG mixture to cope better with wear andhave a longer service life.","open_xpd_uuid":"ec3f72zz","resilient_flooring_thickness":null,"masonry_cement_astm_c91_type":null,"cmu_glass_powder_containing":null,"steel_rebar_diameter_min":null,"density":"2400 kg /

products included in this EPD are asphalt mixtures distributed by Asfaltsgruppen Öst AB from production plants in Normstorp and Vagnhärad, Sweden. The asphalt mixtures consist mainly of coarse and fine aggregates, bitumen and filler in various grades depending on application.\nABb is usually used as an intermediate layer between the base layer of asphalt and the top layer. On roads with a high proportion of heavy traffic, it provides high stability and durability. \nABD isused as a second layer on roads where noise and hydroplaning is a problem. Both the noice reduction effect and the draining capacity decreases quite quickly over time, which is why such surfaces need to be re-laid more often to maintain the function.\nABS isused as the top layer on medium and high traffic roads. It provides durable roads that are not deformed and can withstand hard loads. Rainwater can be drained away into the coarse structure that the mixture forms.\nABT could be used for everything from garage driveways to low-and medium traffic roads and streets. The mixture does not have as high resistance to deformation as other asphalt mixtures and istherefor not used on roads with heavy traffic. \nABÖ is a top layer with open structure that can be used for sludged pavings or as base layer for running tracks.\nAG is often used as the base layer on roads. It could be used on all types of roads and surfaces. It can also be advantageously laid out in thick layers.\nAGF is often used as the base layer on roads and can also be used as a top layer. It could be used on all types of roads and surfaces. It can also be advantageously laid out in thick layers. The AGF mixture has a higher binder content then the AG mixture to cope better with wear andhave a longer service life.","open_xpd_uuid":"ec3pxe1c","resilient_flooring_thickness":null,"masonry_cement_astm_c91_type":null,"cmu_glass_powder_containing":null,"steel_rebar_diameter_min":null,"density":"2400 kg /

asphalt mixtures produced at the declared plant comprise different hot mix asphalt (HMA), warm mix asphalt (WMA) and polymer modified asphalt (PMB). The main components of the asphalt mixtures are mineral rock aggregates, bitumen and additives. The amount of each component varies depending on the asphalt type. Additives include adhesive agents, such as hydraulic binders and fibres. These additives normally constitute less than 0,5 weight-% of the final product. Since asphalt mixtures comprise valuable resources and are 100% recyclable, they are recycled into new asphalt mixtures. Accordingly, Recycled Asphalt Pavement (RAP) is normally added to the asphalt mixture, replacing virgin aggregate and virgin bitumen. The share of RAP in the asphalt mixtures declared varies between 0-40 weight-%. Both the annual mean and potential maximum shares of RAP are declared for the asphalt mixtures covered by this

asphalt mixtures produced at the declared plant comprise different hot mix asphalt (HMA), warm mix asphalt (WMA) and polymer modified asphalt (PMB). The main components of the asphalt mixtures are mineral rock aggregates, bitumen and additives. The amount of each component varies depending on the asphalt type. Additives include adhesive agents, such as hydraulic binders and fibres. These additives normally constitute less than 0,5 weight-% of the final product. Since asphalt mixtures comprise valuable resources and are 100% recyclable, they are recycled into new asphalt mixtures. Accordingly, Recycled Asphalt Pavement (RAP) is normally added to the asphalt mixture, replacing virgin aggregate and virgin bitumen. The share of RAP in the asphalt mixtures declared varies between 0-40 weight-%. Both the annual mean and potential maximum shares of RAP are declared for the asphalt mixtures covered by this

asphalt mixtures produced at the declared plant comprise different hot mix asphalt (HMA), warm mix asphalt (WMA) and polymer modified asphalt (PMB). The main components of the asphalt mixtures are mineral rock aggregates, bitumen and additives. The amount of each component varies depending on the asphalt type. Additives include adhesive agents, such as hydraulic binders and fibres. These additives normally constitute less than 0,5 weight-% of the final product. Since asphalt mixtures comprise valuable resources and are 100% recyclable, they are recycled into new asphalt mixtures. Accordingly, Recycled Asphalt Pavement (RAP) is normally added to the asphalt mixture, replacing virgin aggregate and virgin bitumen. The share of RAP in the asphalt mixtures declared varies between 0-40 weight-%. Both the annual mean and potential maximum shares of RAP are declared for the asphalt mixtures covered by this

asphalt mixtures produced at the declared plant comprise different hot mix asphalt (HMA), warm mix asphalt (WMA) and polymer modified asphalt (PMB). The main components of the asphalt mixtures are mineral rock aggregates, bitumen and additives. The amount of each component varies depending on the asphalt type. Additives include adhesive agents, such as hydraulic binders and fibres. These additives normally constitute less than 0,5 weight-% of the final product. Since asphalt mixtures comprise valuable resources and are 100% recyclable, they are recycled into new asphalt mixtures. Accordingly, Recycled Asphalt Pavement (RAP) is normally added to the asphalt mixture, replacing virgin aggregate and virgin bitumen. The share of RAP in the asphalt mixtures declared varies between 0-40 weight-%. Both the annual mean and potential maximum shares of RAP are declared for the asphalt mixtures covered by this

asphalt mixtures produced at the declared plant comprise different hot mix asphalt (HMA), warm mix asphalt (WMA) and polymer modified asphalt (PMB). The main components of the asphalt mixtures are mineral rock aggregates, bitumen and additives. The amount of each component varies depending on the asphalt type. Additives include adhesive agents, such as hydraulic binders and fibres. These additives normally constitute less than 0,5 weight-% of the final product. Since asphalt mixtures comprise valuable resources and are 100% recyclable, they are recycled into new asphalt mixtures. Accordingly, Recycled Asphalt Pavement (RAP) is normally added to the asphalt mixture, replacing virgin aggregate and virgin bitumen. The share of RAP in the asphalt mixtures declared varies between 0-40 weight-%. Both the annual mean and potential maximum shares of RAP are declared for the asphalt mixtures covered by this
