EPD is for reinforcing bar fabricated by Champion Fabricating & Supply’s facility, located in Midvale, Utah. Fabricated reinforcing bar is a steel bar used in the reinforcement of concrete. The rebar surface is rolled with a deformed pat- tern in order to form an improved mechanical bond with the concrete. Mechanical properties, sizes, and deformation dimensions are specified by ASTM standards A615 and A706. Fabricated rebar is rebar that has been cut and bent as necessary to form shapes according to the needs of a particular project. Rebar sizes range from #3 through #18. In accordance with the PCR, the declared unit and product density is shown in Table 1. Table 1. Declared unit for fabricated reinforcing bar and the approximate density. Parameter Value Declared Unit 1 metric ton Density 7,850 kg/m3 MATERIAL CONTENT The representative reinforcing bar products contain approximately 95.4% recycled scrap steel content with 4.5% alloys and additives. In general, ASTM A615 and A706 reinforcing bar will contain 95-99% recycled iron, < 2% Manganese, < 1% Carbon, < 1% Chromium, <1% Silicon, and a total of < 1.5% Nickel, Sulfur, Vanadium, Phosphorous,

EPD is for reinforcing bar fabricated by Farwest’s facilities, located in Eugene, Oregon and Vancouver, Washington. Fabricated reinforcing bar is a steel bar used in the reinforcement of concrete. The rebar surface is rolled with a deformed pattern in order to form an improved mechanical bond with the concrete. Mechanical properties, sizes, and deformation dimensions are specified by ASTM standards A615 and A706. Fabricated rebar is rebar that has been cut and bent as necessary to form shapes according to the needs of a particular project. Rebar sizes range from #3 through #18. In accordance with the PCR, the declared unit and product density is shown in Table 1. Table 1. Declared unit for fabricated reinforcing bar and the approximate density. Parameter Value Declared Unit 1 metric ton Density 7,850 kg/m3 MATERIAL CONTENT The representative reinforcing bar products contain approximately 95.4% recycled scrap steel content with 4.5% alloys and additives. In general, ASTM A615 and A706 reinforcing bar will contain 95-99% recycled iron, < 2% Manganese, < 1% Carbon, < 1% Chromium, <1% Silicon, and a total of < 1.5% Nickel, Sulfur, Vanadium, Phosphorous,

EPD is for reinforcing bar produced by Cascade Steel mill located in McMinnville, Oregon. Fabricated reinforcing bar is a steel bar used in the reinforcement of concrete. The rebar surface is rolled with a deformed pattern in order to form an improved mechanical bond with the concrete. Mechanical properties, sizes, and deformation dimensions are specified by ASTM standards A615, A706, and A1035. Fabricated rebar is rebar that has been cut and bent as necessary to form shapes according to the needs of a particular project. Rebar sizes range from #3 through #18. In accordance with the PCR, the declared unit and product density is shown in Table 1. Table 1. Declared unit for fabricated reinforcing bar and the approximate density.

reinforcing bar is a carbon steel bar used in the reinforcement of concrete. The rebar surface is rolled with a deformed pattern in order to form an improved mechanical bond with the concrete. Mechanical properties, sizes, and deformation dimensions are specified by ASTM. Welded Wire Reinforcement (WWR) or Structurally Welded Wire Reinforcement (SWWR) are used in the reinforcement of concrete. It consists of a series of longitudinal and transverse wires, arranged at right angles to each other and welded at all points of intersection. The wires can be smooth, deformed, or drawn with a deformation pattern. Mechanical properties, sizes, and cross-sectional area dimensions are specified by ASTM. Fabricated rebar/mesh has been cut and bent as necessary to form shapes according to the needs of a particular project. In accordance with the PCR, the declared unit and product density are shown in Table 1. Table 1. Declared unit for reinforcing bar and welded wire reinforcement and the approximate density. Parameter Value Density 7,850 kg/m3 MATERIAL CONTENT The fabricated carbon steel products in this EPD contain at least 90% recycled steel scrap with an alloy content lower than 5%.

EPD is for reinforcing bar fabricated by Camlbin Steel Service, Inc.’s facility located in Rocklin, California. Fabricated reinforcing bar is a steel bar used in the reinforcement of concrete. The rebar surface is rolled with a deformed pattern in order to form an improved mechanical bond with the concrete. Mechanical properties, sizes, and deformation dimen- sions are specified by ASTM standards A615 and A706. Fabricated rebar is rebar that has been cut and bent as necessary to form shapes according to the needs of a particular project. Rebar sizes range from #3 through #18. In accordance with the PCR, the declared unit and product density is shown in Table 1. Table 1. Declared unit for fabricated reinforcing bar and the approximate density. Parameter Value Declared Unit 1 metric ton Density 7,850 kg/m3 MATERIAL CONTENT The representative reinforcing bar products contain approximately 95.4% recycled scrap steel content with 4.5% alloys and additives. In general, ASTM A615 and A706 reinforcing bar will contain 95-99% recycled iron, < 2% Manganese, < 1% Carbon, < 1% Chromium, <1% Silicon, and a total of < 1.5% Nickel, Sulfur, Vanadium, Phosphorous, Molybdenum, and other alloying elements. Reinforcing bar products under normal conditions do not present inhalation, ingestion, or contact health hazards. These products, when used inside the building envelope, do not include materials or substances that have a potential route of exposure to humans or flora/fauna in the environment.","open_xpd_uuid":"ec3xhtwr","resilient_flooring_thickness":null,"masonry_cement_astm_c91_type":null,"cmu_glass_powder_containing":null,"steel_rebar_diameter_min":null,"density":"7850 kg /

Fabricated rebar has been cut and bent as necessary to form shapes to the needs of a particular project. Rebar sizes range from 10mm to 55mm. In accordance with the PCR, the declared unit and product density is shown in Table 1. Table 1. Declared unit for fabricated reinforcing bar and the approximate density. Parameter Value Density 7800 kg/m3 MATERIAL CONTENT Including alloying elements, the fabricated product is composed of 100% steel. Reinforcing bar products under normal conditions do not present inhalation, ingestion, or contact health hazards. These products, when used inside the building envelope, do not include materials or substances that have a potential route of exposure to humans or flora/fauna in the environment. Table 2.

steel is encased in concrete in order to improve the tensile strength of the latter in structures bearing axial or bending loads. The steel is relatively simple and comprises about 99 % iron. The reinforcing-steel products consist of cut-to-length and bent pieces starting from bars in long length or coil supplied from a steel plant. The bar surface is often ribbed in order to facilitate bonding between steel and concrete. The cut and bent parts can be of standard shape or bespoke in accord with drawings supplied by a construction company. In many instances, parts are welded or otherwise joined together to form more complex cage arrangements tailored to the final construction. The finished parts are packed and delivered to the construction site ready to have concrete poured around them. Steel reinforcing will normally last over the life of the concrete structure. It is 100 % recyclable in the event that the structure is demolished. This EPD has been registered as an ECO Platform EPD with ECO EPD Reference number 00001189. The International EPD System is a founding member of the ECO Platform and its procedures has undergone a peer audit to be able to use this logotype. All EPDs of construction products from different programmes that carry the ECO logotype are listed

EPD is for reinforcing bar fabricated by Pacific Steel Group’s facilities, located in Bloomington, California and Napa, California. Fabricated reinforcing bar is a steel bar used in the reinforcement of concrete. The rebar surface is rolled with a deformed pattern in order to form an improved mechanical bond with the concrete. Mechanical properties, sizes, and deformation dimensions are specified by ASTM standards A615 and A706. Fabricated rebar is rebar that has been cut and bent as necessary to form shapes according to the needs of a particular project. Rebar sizes range from #3 through #18. In accordance with the PCR, the declared unit and product density is shown in Table 1. Table 1. Declared unit for fabricated reinforcing bar and the approximate density. Parameter Value Declared Unit 1 metric ton Density 7,850 kg/m3 MATERIAL CONTENT The representative reinforcing bar products contain approximately 95.4% recycled scrap steel content with 4.5% alloys and additives. In general, ASTM A615 and A706 reinforcing bar will contain 95-99% recycled iron, < 2% Manganese, < 1% Carbon, < 1% Chromium, <1% Silicon, and a total of < 1.5% Nickel, Sulfur, Vanadium, Phosphorous, Molybdenum, and other alloying elements. Reinforcing bar products under normal conditions do not present inhalation, ingestion, or contact health hazards. These products, when used inside the building envelope, do not include materials or substances that have a potential route of exposure to humans or flora/fauna in the environment.","open_xpd_uuid":"ec3yhbpy","resilient_flooring_thickness":null,"masonry_cement_astm_c91_type":null,"cmu_glass_powder_containing":null,"steel_rebar_diameter_min":null,"density":"7.85E+03

EPD is for reinforcing bar fabricated by Pacific Steel Group’s facilities, located in Bloomington, California and Napa, California. Fabricated reinforcing bar is a steel bar used in the reinforcement of concrete. The rebar surface is rolled with a deformed pattern in order to form an improved mechanical bond with the concrete. Mechanical properties, sizes, and deformation dimensions are specified by ASTM standards A615 and A706. Fabricated rebar is rebar that has been cut and bent as necessary to form shapes according to the needs of a particular project. Rebar sizes range from #3 through #18. In accordance with the PCR, the declared unit and product density is shown in Table 1. Table 1. Declared unit for fabricated reinforcing bar and the approximate density. Parameter Value Declared Unit 1 metric ton Density 7,850 kg/m3 MATERIAL CONTENT The representative reinforcing bar products contain approximately 95.4% recycled scrap steel content with 4.5% alloys and additives. In general, ASTM A615 and A706 reinforcing bar will contain 95-99% recycled iron, < 2% Manganese, < 1% Carbon, < 1% Chromium, <1% Silicon, and a total of < 1.5% Nickel, Sulfur, Vanadium, Phosphorous, Molybdenum, and other alloying elements. Reinforcing bar products under normal conditions do not present inhalation, ingestion, or contact health hazards. These products, when used inside the building envelope, do not include materials or substances that have a potential route of exposure to humans or flora/fauna in the environment.","open_xpd_uuid":"ec382fg8","resilient_flooring_thickness":null,"masonry_cement_astm_c91_type":null,"cmu_glass_powder_containing":null,"steel_rebar_diameter_min":null,"density":"7850 kg /

EPD is determined by fabricated reinforcing bar produced by three of Salit Steel’s facilities in Saskatchewan, Ontario, and British Columbia intended to represent production at all facilities. Fabricated reinforcing bar is a steel bar used in the reinforcement of concrete. The rebar surface is rolled with a deformed pattern in order to form an improved mechanical bond with the concrete. Mechanical properties, sizes, and deformation dimensions are specified by Canadian Standards Association (CSA) and Reinforcing Steel Institute of Canada (RSIC). Fabricated rebar is cut and bent as necessary to form shapes to the needs of a particular project. Rebar sizes range from 10m to 55m at bar grades of 400 and 500. In accordance with the PCR, the declared unit and product density is shown in Table 1. Table 1. Declared unit for fabricated reinforcing bar and the approximate density.
