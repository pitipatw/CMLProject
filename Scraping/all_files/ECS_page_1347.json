ISIDAÇ 40 is defined under the special cement class. Calcium aluminate cement is composed of hydraulic calcium aluminates as main constituent. chemicals producers. Another important use is inner plating of sewage pipes in the precast form where resistance to acid and sulphate attacks is paramount. Due to its high alumina content, ISIDAÇ 40 can resist up to 1300 °C. Therefore, it presents an economic and viable solution for the industrial floorings that requires high temperatures. Cement is the adhesive or glue which, when sets, binds particles of fine aggregate together to produce mortar. When mixed with water the cement forms a paste called the fine matrix. Cements are hydraulic materials, this means that they depend upon a reaction with water rather than air for strengthening. When water is added to cement a chemical reaction called hydration commences immediately. The reaction continues while water is still present. After hardening, it retains its strength and stability even under

Holcim Industrial Cement is recommended for industrial constructions with greater resistance and durability. Its controlled C3A content of less than 8% provides a moderate heat of hydration which favors the reduction of surface cracking due to plastic shrinkage, adequately controlling the curing parameters. The use of Holcim Pozzolana, as a clinker substitute, in the Industrial cement generates denser and more durable concretes, whose characteristics make them resistant to the action of aggressive media, the presence of sulfates, chlorides and seawater. Due to its durability characteristics, it is a substitute suitable for Type II Portland Cement (ASTM C150) with moderate resistance to sulfates. Recommended uses: •\tStructural type concretes •\tAggression resistant concrete •\tPrecast and prestressed structures •\tReady-mix concrete •\tProduction of masonry and precast elements •\tWaterproof

declared product is Çimsa Super White - CEM I 52,5 R - White Portland Cement (Çimsa Super White) manufactured in accordance with / EN197-1/ by Çimsa. Portland cement is composed of 90-95% of clinker as main constituent. Cement is the adhesive or glue which, when sets, binds particles of fine aggregate together to produce mortar. When mixed with water the cement forms a paste called the fine matrix. Cements are hydraulic materials, this means that they depend upon a reaction with water rather than air for strengthening. When water is added to cement a chemical reaction called hydration commences immediately. The reaction continues while water is still present. After hardening, it retains itsstrength and stability even under water.","open_xpd_uuid":"ec3fj60j","resilient_flooring_thickness":null,"masonry_cement_astm_c91_type":null,"cmu_glass_powder_containing":null,"steel_rebar_diameter_min":null,"density":"1440

RESISTO40 is defined under the special cement class. Calcium aluminate cement is composed of hydraulic calcium aluminates as main constituent. for building chemicals producers. Another important use is inner plating of sewage pipes in the precast form where resistance to acid and sulphate attacks is paramount. Due to its high alumina content, RESISTO40 can resist up to 1300 °C. Therefore, it presents an economic and viable solution for the industrial floorings that requires high temperatures. Cement is the adhesive or glue which, when sets, binds particles of fine aggregate together to produce mortar. When mixed with water the cement forms a paste called the fine matrix. Cements are hydraulic materials, this means that they depend upon a reaction with water rather than air for strengthening. When water is added to cement a chemical reaction called hydration commences immediately. The reaction continues while water is still present. After hardening, it retains its strength and stability even under water.","open_xpd_uuid":"ec30mf25","resilient_flooring_thickness":null,"masonry_cement_astm_c91_type":null,"cmu_glass_powder_containing":null,"steel_rebar_diameter_min":null,"density":"1.44E+03

EPD reports environmental transparency information for five cement products, produced by Lehigh Cement at their Edmonton, Alberta, facility. These cements are hydraulic binders and are manufactured by grinding cement clinker and other main or minor constituents into a finely ground, usually grey colored mineral powder. Cement is just one ingredient in the mixture that creates concrete, but it is the most chemically active ingredient and crucial to the quality of the final product. When mixed with water, cement acts as a glue to bind together the sand, gravel or crushed stone to form concrete, one of the most durable, resilient and widely used construction materials in the world. Our environmentally friendly product is branded as EcoCem®PLUS and was developed to reduce embodied carbon (measured through GWP). This product is a general use limestone blended (GULb) and a high sulfate (HSLb) resistant product for concrete and mortar as well as all the other various applications for cement, including engineered soils and solidification/stabilization of materials and wastes. The Lehigh Edmonton plant oil well cement conforms to an American Petroleum Institute (API) Spec 10A Class G. This cement is used for oil well grouting or cementing and is able to withstand high temperatures and pressures of deep wells. DECLARED UNIT The declared unit is one metric tonne of GULb/HSLb, GU, HE, HS and OWG cement. SYSTEM BOUNDARY This EPD is a cradle-to-gate EPD covering A1-A3 stages of the life

EPD reports environmental transparency information for five cement products, produced by Lehigh Cement at their Edmonton, Alberta, facility. These cements are hydraulic binders and are manufactured by grinding cement clinker and other main or minor constituents into a finely ground, usually grey colored mineral powder. Cement is just one ingredient in the mixture that creates concrete, but it is the most chemically active ingredient and crucial to the quality of the final product. When mixed with water, cement acts as a glue to bind together the sand, gravel or crushed stone to form concrete, one of the most durable, resilient and widely used construction materials in the world. Our environmentally friendly product is branded as EcoCem®PLUS and was developed to reduce embodied carbon (measured through GWP). This product is a general use limestone blended (GULb) and a high sulfate (HSLb) resistant product for concrete and mortar as well as all the other various applications for cement, including engineered soils and solidification/stabilization of materials and wastes. The Lehigh Edmonton plant oil well cement conforms to an American Petroleum Institute (API) Spec 10A Class G. This cement is used for oil well grouting or cementing and is able to withstand high temperatures and pressures of deep wells. DECLARED UNIT The declared unit is one metric tonne of GULb/HSLb, GU, HE, HS and OWG cement. SYSTEM BOUNDARY This EPD is a cradle-to-gate EPD covering A1-A3 stages of the life

declared product is Çimsa REFRO40 - Calcium Aluminate Cement (REFRO40) manufactured in accordance with /EN14647/. REFRO40 is defined under the special cement class. Calcium aluminate cement is composed of hydraulic calcium aluminates as main constituent. Cement is the adhesive or glue which, when sets, binds particles of fine aggregate together to produce mortar. When mixed with water the cement forms a paste called the fine matrix. Cements are hydraulic materials, this means that they depend upon a reaction with water rather than air for strengthening. When water is added to cement a chemical reaction called hydration commences immediately. The reaction continues while water is still present. After hardening, it retains its strength and stability even under water. This EPD has been registered under the scope of mutual recognition between Institut Bauen und Umwelt e.V. (IBU) and The International EPD® System. The EPD thus has the right to bear the logotype of both programmes, and is also published here:

EPD reports environmental transparency information\nfor five cement products, produced by Lehigh Cement at\ntheir Nazareth PA facility.

Cement is just one\ningredient in the mixture that creates concrete, but it is the\nmost chemically active ingredient and crucial to the quality\nof the final product. When mixed with water, cement acts as\na glue to bind together the sand, gravel or crushed stone to\nform concrete, one of the most durable, resilient and widely\nused construction materials in the world. Our Type IL is branded as EcoCem®PLC and was developed to be\nmore environmentally friendly by reducing its carbon footprint (reduction measured through GWP).
