The EPD is a commitment to being guided by objectively measurable practices and is a testament to our transparency. We are using EPD data to guide our resourcing, energy choices, waste, and production practices and have proudly cut our CO² emissions by over 20% leading into our last measured year of production. This EPD presents a cradle-to-gate declaration of the environmental impact of Allied Concrete’s ready-mix concrete using cement imported into New Zealand by Holcim NZ Limited.

Concrete is a leading supplier of ready-mix concrete in New Zealand. As a large national concrete supplier, Allied Concrete can lead and influence change. Alongside many other environmental initiatives, in 2014, Allied Concrete made a conscious decision to start measuring emissions and released an Environmental Product Declaration (EPD). The EPD is a commitment to being guided by objectively measurable practices and is a testament to our transparency. We are using EPD data to guide our resourcing, energy choices, waste, and production practices and have proudly cut our CO² emissions by over 20% leading into our last measured year of production. This EPD presents a cradle-to-gate declaration of the environmental impact of Allied Concrete’s ready-mix concrete using cement imported into New Zealand by Holcim NZ Limited.

The EPD is a commitment to being guided by objectively measurable practices and is a testament to our transparency. We are using EPD data to guide our resourcing, energy choices, waste, and production practices and have proudly cut our CO² emissions by over 20% leading into our last measured year of production. This EPD presents a cradle-to-gate declaration of the environmental impact of Allied Concrete’s ready-mix concrete using cement imported into New Zealand by Holcim NZ Limited.

Concrete is a leading supplier of ready-mix concrete in New Zealand. As a large national concrete supplier, Allied Concrete can lead and influence change. Alongside many other environmental initiatives, in 2014, Allied Concrete made a conscious decision to start measuring emissions and released an Environmental Product Declaration (EPD). The EPD is a commitment to being guided by objectively measurable practices and is a testament to our transparency. We are using EPD data to guide our resourcing, energy choices, waste, and production practices and have proudly cut our CO² emissions by over 20% leading into our last measured year of production. This EPD presents a cradle-to-gate declaration of the environmental impact of Allied Concrete’s ready-mix concrete using cement imported into New Zealand by Holcim NZ Limited. It covers raw material supply, transportation, and

Concrete is a leading supplier of ready-mix concrete in New Zealand. As a large national concrete supplier, Allied Concrete can lead and influence change. Alongside many other environmental initiatives, in 2014, Allied Concrete made a conscious decision to start measuring emissions and released an Environmental Product Declaration (EPD). The EPD is a commitment to being guided by objectively measurable practices and is a testament to our transparency. We are using EPD data to guide our resourcing, energy choices, waste, and production practices and have proudly cut our CO² emissions by over 20% leading into our last measured year of production. This EPD presents a cradle-to-gate declaration of the environmental impact of Allied Concrete’s ready-mix concrete using cement imported into New Zealand by Holcim NZ Limited.

Concrete is a leading supplier of ready-mix concrete in New Zealand. As a large national concrete supplier, Allied Concrete can lead and influence change. Alongside many other environmental initiatives, in 2014, Allied Concrete made a conscious decision to start measuring emissions and released an Environmental Product Declaration (EPD). The EPD is a commitment to being guided by objectively measurable practices and is a testament to our transparency. We are using EPD data to guide our resourcing, energy choices, waste, and production practices and have proudly cut our CO² emissions by over 20% leading into our last measured year of production. This EPD presents a cradle-to-gate declaration of the environmental impact of Allied Concrete’s ready-mix concrete using cement imported into New Zealand by Holcim NZ Limited. It covers raw material supply, transportation, and

The EPD is a commitment to being guided by objectively measurable practices and is a testament to our transparency. We are using EPD data to guide our resourcing, energy choices, waste, and production practices and have proudly cut our CO² emissions by over 20% leading into our last measured year of production. This EPD presents a cradle-to-gate declaration of the environmental impact of Allied Concrete’s ready-mix concrete using cement imported into New Zealand by Holcim NZ Limited.

Concrete is a leading supplier of ready-mix concrete in New Zealand. As a large national concrete supplier, Allied Concrete can lead and influence change. Alongside many other environmental initiatives, in 2014, Allied Concrete made a conscious decision to start measuring emissions and released an Environmental Product Declaration (EPD). The EPD is a commitment to being guided by objectively measurable practices and is a testament to our transparency. We are using EPD data to guide our resourcing, energy choices, waste, and production practices and have proudly cut our CO² emissions by over 20% leading into our last measured year of production. This EPD presents a cradle-to-gate declaration of the environmental impact of Allied Concrete’s ready-mix concrete using cement imported into New Zealand by Holcim NZ Limited. It covers raw material supply, transportation, and

Concrete is a leading supplier of ready-mix concrete in New Zealand. As a large national concrete supplier, Allied Concrete can lead and influence change. Alongside many other environmental initiatives, in 2014, Allied Concrete made a conscious decision to start measuring emissions and released an Environmental Product Declaration (EPD). The EPD is a commitment to being guided by objectively measurable practices and is a testament to our transparency. We are using EPD data to guide our resourcing, energy choices, waste, and production practices and have proudly cut our CO² emissions by over 20% leading into our last measured year of production. This EPD presents a cradle-to-gate declaration of the environmental impact of Allied Concrete’s ready-mix concrete using cement imported into New Zealand by Holcim NZ Limited. It covers raw material supply, transportation, and

Concrete is a leading supplier of ready-mix concrete in New Zealand. As a large national concrete supplier, Allied Concrete can lead and influence change. Alongside many other environmental initiatives, in 2014, Allied Concrete made a conscious decision to start measuring emissions and released an Environmental Product Declaration (EPD). The EPD is a commitment to being guided by objectively measurable practices and is a testament to our transparency. We are using EPD data to guide our resourcing, energy choices, waste, and production practices and have proudly cut our CO² emissions by over 20% leading into our last measured year of production. This EPD presents a cradle-to-gate declaration of the environmental impact of Allied Concrete’s ready-mix concrete using cement imported into New Zealand by Holcim NZ Limited. It covers raw material supply, transportation, and

Concrete is a leading supplier of ready-mix concrete in New Zealand. As a large national concrete supplier, Allied Concrete can lead and influence change. Alongside many other environmental initiatives, in 2014, Allied Concrete made a conscious decision to start measuring emissions and released an Environmental Product Declaration (EPD). The EPD is a commitment to being guided by objectively measurable practices and is a testament to our transparency. We are using EPD data to guide our resourcing, energy choices, waste, and production practices and have proudly cut our CO² emissions by over 20% leading into our last measured year of production. This EPD presents a cradle-to-gate declaration of the environmental impact of Allied Concrete’s ready-mix concrete using cement imported into New Zealand by Holcim NZ Limited.

New Zealand’s largest manufacturer of ready mixed concrete and concrete masonry products, Firth Industries is committed to continue delivering a sustainable contribution to New Zealand building and infrastructure landscape for many years to come. Developing, manufacturing and delivering concrete and concrete products to New Zealanders for almost a century. Firth, has over 70 manufacturing sites across the country spanning from the Bay of Islands down to Invercargill and employ over 650 employees. Firth have been reviewing the environmental credentials of its ready-mixed concrete for a considerable period and recognise that the transparency of an EPD and the calculation of Firth’s Global Warming Potential footprint is key to providing a base line for minimising our impact on carbon emissions, waste production and water use. Firth are using EPD data to provide lower carbon concrete options to the market, allowing us to calculate the environmental credentials of any Firth Certified concrete mix from any location. Partnering with Firth Industries for concrete supply provides a very advantageous starting point in achieving your sustainability goals. This is a ‘cradle-to-gate’ EPD covering modules A1 to A3 from European Standard EN 15804.
