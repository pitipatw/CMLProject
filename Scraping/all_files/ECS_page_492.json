is the most abundant man-made material on earth.

Chemical admix-\ntures may also be added to enhance speciﬁc properties of the fresh or hardened concrete, such as workability,\ndurability, or early and ﬁnal strength. Concrete is workable right after production so that it can be transported,\npoured, pumped, installed, compacted on the project site and over time it hardens and develops strengths.

Chemical admix-\ntures may also be added to enhance speciﬁc properties of the fresh or hardened concrete, such as workability,\ndurability, or early and ﬁnal strength. Concrete is workable right after production so that it can be transported,\npoured, pumped, installed, compacted on the project site and over time it hardens and develops strengths.
