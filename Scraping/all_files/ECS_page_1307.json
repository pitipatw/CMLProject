wood wool panels are made of fir wood coming from sustainable management forests (PEFC™ or FSC®) and mineral binders mainly Portland cement, white or grey, and marble powder. The mix of the mentioned raw materials, the density of the mixture and the inclusion of additional layers/elements give the panels specific technical properties which make them very versatile multi-purpose products for many building applications. The cellular structure of wood gives the insulation panel lightness and elasticity. The gaps between the fibres gives sound absorption and excellent ability to adhere to all forms of mortar. The presence of Portland cement gives high resistance to water and frost and superior mechanical properties such as resistance to bending and compression and high fire resistance. The products included in the present EPD are monolayer panels and are classified in two different divisions. BUILDING | CONSTRUCTION regards building insulation products, consisting mainly of grey Portland cement and 3 mm standard texture and includes the following panels: CELENIT N and N/C (monolayer, grey cement), CELENIT R, RA (monolayer with wooden laths) and RAB (same product as RA but with white cement). ACOUSTIC | DESIGN division is specific for sound absorbing applications and regards panels selected for their aesthetic quality, mainly with white Portland cement; it includes the following panels: CELENIT ABE, AB and NB (white cement and respectively extra-thin, thin and standard textures), CELENIT AE, A (grey cement and respectively extra-thin and thin textures), ABE/A2, AB/A2, AE/A2, A/A2 (same descriptions for previous boards but in Euroclass A2-s1,d0). The products are compliant to the EN 13168 standard “Thermal insulation products for buildings. Factory made wood wool (WW) products” and to the EN 13964 “Suspended ceilings.

(Polyiso) is a cellular closed-cell rigid foam plastic insulation. Polyiso roof insulation boards consist of a foam core sandwiched between twofacers (top and bottom). The foam core is comprised of a thermoset polymer that hardens by curing from a viscous liquid prepolymer. The rigid foam is produced through the reaction of methylene diphenylene diisocyanate (MDI) with polyester polyol. Other additives such as catalyst, surfactant, flame retardant, and blowing agent (pentane or pentane blends) are part of the formulation. Pentane is a hydrocarbon with negligible ozone depletion potential (ODP) (U.S. EPA, 2018) and low global warming potential (GWP) (U.S. EPA, 2020). For nearly 20 years, the polyiso industry has only utilized pentane or pentane blends in product formulations. Upon mixing of the components, the viscous pre-polymer is laid between the facers, and a chemical reaction cross-links polymer chains creating a rigid and durable cellular structure. For roofing applications, the most common facer is a glass fiber reinforced cellulosic facer (GRF) produced predominantly from recycled post-consumer and/or post-industrial fibers. Polyiso roof insulation is also manufactured with polymer-bonded coated glass facer (CGF), consisting of a glass fiber mat coated with polymers. Both facer types play a critical role in accommodating a continuous manufacturing process.","open_xpd_uuid":"ec3u8fbb","resilient_flooring_thickness":null,"masonry_cement_astm_c91_type":null,"cmu_glass_powder_containing":null,"steel_rebar_diameter_min":null,"density":null,"access_flooring_finish_material":null,"concrete_compressive_strength_other_d":null,"wall_base_material":null,"gwp":"2.1758

The Polyiso wall insulation boards consist\nof a foam core sandwiched between twofacers (top and bottom). The foam core is comprised of a thermoset polymer\nthat hardens by curing from a viscous liquid prepolymer. The rigid foam is produced through the reaction of methylene\ndiphenylene diisocyanate (MDI) with polyester polyol. Other additives such as catalyst, surfactant, flame retardant, and\nblowing agent (pentane or pentane blends) are part of the formulation. Pentane is a hydrocarbon with negligible ozone\ndepletion potential (ODP) (U.S. EPA, 2018) and low global warming potential (GWP) (U.S. EPA, 2020). For nearly 20\nyears, the polyiso industry has only utilized pentane or pentane blends in product formulations. Upon mixing of the\ncomponents, the viscous pre-polymer is laid between the facers, and a chemical reaction cross-links polymer chains\ncreating a rigid and durable cellular structure. For wall applications, this study considers one type of facer, a glass\nreinforced aluminum foil facer, which plays a critical role in accommodating a continuous manufacturing process.","open_xpd_uuid":"ec36qhnj","resilient_flooring_thickness":null,"masonry_cement_astm_c91_type":null,"cmu_glass_powder_containing":null,"steel_rebar_diameter_min":null,"density":null,"access_flooring_finish_material":null,"concrete_compressive_strength_other_d":null,"wall_base_material":null,"gwp":"4.2509

expanded graphite polystyrene sintered steam KLIMAEXPERT ETA AIRTECH expanded steam sintered polystyrene Each of these systems has been studied with two alternative adhesivefinishing products. The systems include also: - Klima Flex and Keraklima Eco, single-component mineral adhesivefinishing products, specifically intended for laying and levelling systems made of extruded polystyrene, expanded polystyrene and polystyrene foam, polyurethane, cork, mineral and glass wool panels laid on concrete, clay block, cement-based plaster and mineral and cement-based finishing products. They are used both as adhesive and smoothing layer. - Kerakover Eco Acrilex Fondo, mineral intermediate coat to prepare substrates for the paint cycle. Based on water-based acrylic resins, for internal and external surfaces, it is a high power filler to correct imperfections in the substrate. Specifically intended for filling stabilized crazing and evening out absorption - Kerakover Eco Kompact, fibrous, mineral covering, completely coloured, based on water-based acrylic-siloxane resins and waterproofing siloxanes. Compliant with the performance requirements of standard CE EN 15824 (Specifications for external renders and internal plasters based on organic binders), it creates high-thickness decorative coverings

The systems include also: - Klima Flex and Keraklima Eco, single-component mineral adhesivefinishing products, specifically intended for laying and levelling systems made of extruded polystyrene, expanded polystyrene and polystyrene foam, polyurethane, cork, mineral and glass wool panels laid on concrete, clay block, cement-based plaster and mineral and cement-based finishing products. They are used both as adhesive and smoothing layer. - Kerakover Eco Acrilex Fondo, mineral intermediate coat to prepare substrates for the paint cycle. Based on water-based acrylic resins, for internal and external surfaces, it is a high power filler to correct imperfections in the substrate. Specifically intended for filling stabilized crazing and evening out absorption - Kerakover Eco Kompact, fibrous, mineral covering, completely coloured, based on water-based acrylic-siloxane resins and waterproofing siloxanes.

wood wool panels are made of spruce wood coming from sustainable management forests (PEFC™ or FSC®) and mineral binders mainly Portland cement, white or grey, and marble powder. The mix of the mentioned raw materials, the density of the mixture and the inclusion of additional layers/elements give the panels specific technical properties which make them very versatile multi-purpose products for many building applications. The cellular structure of wood gives the insulation panel lightness and elasticity. The gaps between the fibres gives sound absorption and excellent ability to adhere to all forms of mortar. The presence of Portland cement gives high resistance to water and frost and superior mechanical properties such as resistance to bending and compression and high fire resistance. The products included in the present EPD are composite panels where a layer of CELENIT is coupled with another layer and they are classified in two different divisions: BUILDING | CONSTRUCTION regards products for roofs applications and consisting of CELENIT N coupled with rockwool, CELENIT L2 or wood fibre, CELENIT F2 and products specific for external insulation covering, consisting of CELENIT N/C coupled with rockwool, CELENIT L2/C or wood fibre, CELENIT F2/C. ACOUSTIC | DESIGN division is specific for sound absorbing applications and regards panels selected for their aesthetic quality, with white Portland cement; CELENIT AB/F is EI 60 fire resistant, consisting of a layer of CELENIT AB coupled to 15 mm thick fire rated plasterboard; CELENIT L2AB25 and CELENIT L2ABE25 are made up of respectively CELENIT AB or ABE 25 mm thick coupled to a layer of mineral wool with non-woven glass fibre. CELENIT L2ABE25C consists of CELENIT ABE 25 mm thick, coupled to a layer of mineral wool. The products are compliant to the EN 13168 standard “Thermal insulation products for buildings.

Mineral Wool Insulation products are comprised of semi- rigid and rigid boards and batts. Mineral wool resists mold, fungi, and is vermin proof due to its being an inorganic material. The R-value of Thermafiber® Mineral Wool Insulation ranges from 3.7 - 4.3 per inch of thickness. It is available in multiple thicknesses, densities, and various facings by product type. Reflected by its R-value, mineral wool's insulating performance is achieved by its densely packed fibers. Its high resistance to heat flow translates into year-round comfort and energy

Mineral Wool Insulation products are comprised of semi- rigid and rigid boards and batts. Mineral wool resists mold, fungi, and is vermin proof due to its being an inorganic material. The R-value of Thermafiber® Mineral Wool Insulation ranges from 3.7 - 4.3 per inch of thickness. It is available in multiple thicknesses, densities, and various facings by product type. Reflected by its R-value, mineral wool's insulating performance is achieved by its densely packed fibers. Its high resistance to heat flow translates into year-round comfort and energy

Mineral Wool Insulation products are comprised of semi- rigid and rigid boards and batts. Mineral wool resists mold, fungi, and is vermin proof due to its being an inorganic material. The R-value of Thermafiber® Mineral Wool Insulation ranges from 3.7 - 4.3 per inch of thickness. It is available in multiple thicknesses, densities, and various facings by product type. Reflected by its R-value, mineral wool's insulating performance is achieved by its densely packed fibers. Its high resistance to heat flow translates into year-round comfort and energy

Mineral Wool Insulation products are comprised of semi- rigid and rigid boards and batts. Mineral wool resists mold, fungi, and is vermin proof due to its being an inorganic material. The R-value of Thermafiber® Mineral Wool Insulation ranges from 3.7 - 4.3 per inch of thickness. It is available in multiple thicknesses, densities, and various facings by product type. Reflected by its R-value, mineral wool's insulating performance is achieved by its densely packed fibers. Its high resistance to heat flow translates into year-round comfort and energy
