(high slump) and sets with no compaction. It is often used in tight or restricted access areas where placing and compacting fill is difficult. Applications include filling large voids such as abandoned underground storage tanks, basements, tunnels, mines, and sewers. It can also be used as paving sub-base, bridge abutment, and retaining wall backfill. Also called Controlled Density Fill (CDF) or Controlled Low Strength Materials (CLSMs). These materials typically have compressive strengths under 1200 psi.","declared_unit":"1 m3","pct50_gwp":"123.1396058 kgCO2e","pct30_gwp":"91.39695183

(high slump) and sets with no compaction. It is often used in tight or restricted access areas where placing and compacting fill is difficult. Applications include filling large voids such as abandoned underground storage tanks, basements, tunnels, mines, and sewers. It can also be used as paving sub-base, bridge abutment, and retaining wall backfill. Also called Controlled Density Fill (CDF) or Controlled Low Strength Materials (CLSMs).

(high slump) and sets with no compaction. It is often used in tight or restricted access areas where placing and compacting fill is difficult. Applications include filling large voids such as abandoned underground storage tanks, basements, tunnels, mines, and sewers. It can also be used as paving sub-base, bridge abutment, and retaining wall backfill. Also called Controlled Density Fill (CDF) or Controlled Low Strength Materials (CLSMs). These materials typically have compressive strengths under 1200 psi.","declared_unit":"1 m3","pct50_gwp":"123.1396058 kgCO2e","pct30_gwp":"91.39695183 kgCO2e"},"decking_board_material":null,"frame_material":null,"hurricane_resistant":null,"best_practice":"82.39655505 kgCO2e","uncertainty_adjusted_gwp":"93.00344495 kgCO2e","jacket_material":null,"galvanized":null,"outlet_level_switching":null,"gypsum_thickness":null,"is_downloadable":true,"intended_application":null,"aac_white":null,"concrete_flexion_strength":null,"fire_radiant_panel_rating_astme648":null,"c1157":null,"elevators_rated_load":null,"cold_finished":null,"warnings":{"concrete_aggregate_size_max":["Not specified"],"concrete_max_slump":["Not specified"],"concrete_slump":["Not specified"],"concrete_w_c_ratio":["Not specified"],"pcr":["EPD issued after PCR expiry date.

(high slump) and sets with no compaction. It is often used in tight or restricted access areas where placing and compacting fill is difficult. Applications include filling large voids such as abandoned underground storage tanks, basements, tunnels, mines, and sewers. It can also be used as paving sub-base, bridge abutment, and retaining wall backfill. Also called Controlled Density Fill (CDF) or Controlled Low Strength Materials (CLSMs). These materials typically have compressive strengths under 1200 psi.","declared_unit":"1 m3","pct50_gwp":"123.1396058 kgCO2e","pct30_gwp":"91.39695183 kgCO2e"},"decking_board_material":null,"frame_material":null,"hurricane_resistant":null,"best_practice":"101.4076814 kgCO2e","uncertainty_adjusted_gwp":"122.5923186 kgCO2e","jacket_material":null,"galvanized":null,"outlet_level_switching":null,"gypsum_thickness":null,"is_downloadable":true,"intended_application":null,"aac_white":null,"concrete_flexion_strength":null,"fire_radiant_panel_rating_astme648":null,"c1157":null,"elevators_rated_load":null,"cold_finished":null,"warnings":{"concrete_aggregate_size_max":["Not specified"],"concrete_max_slump":["Not specified"],"concrete_slump":["Not specified"],"concrete_w_c_ratio":["Not specified"],"pcr":["EPD issued after PCR expiry date.

(high slump) and sets with no compaction. It is often used in tight or restricted access areas where placing and compacting fill is difficult. Applications include filling large voids such as abandoned underground storage tanks, basements, tunnels, mines, and sewers. It can also be used as paving sub-base, bridge abutment, and retaining wall backfill. Also called Controlled Density Fill (CDF) or Controlled Low Strength Materials (CLSMs). These materials typically have compressive strengths under 1200 psi.","declared_unit":"1 m3","pct50_gwp":"123.1396058 kgCO2e","pct30_gwp":"91.39695183

(high slump) and sets with no compaction. It is often used in tight or restricted access areas where placing and compacting fill is difficult. Applications include filling large voids such as abandoned underground storage tanks, basements, tunnels, mines, and sewers. It can also be used as paving sub-base, bridge abutment, and retaining wall backfill. Also called Controlled Density Fill (CDF) or Controlled Low Strength Materials (CLSMs). These materials typically have compressive strengths under 1200 psi.","declared_unit":"1 m3","pct50_gwp":"123.1396058 kgCO2e","pct30_gwp":"91.39695183

(high slump) and sets with no compaction. It is often used in tight or restricted access areas where placing and compacting fill is difficult. Applications include filling large voids such as abandoned underground storage tanks, basements, tunnels, mines, and sewers. It can also be used as paving sub-base, bridge abutment, and retaining wall backfill. Also called Controlled Density Fill (CDF) or Controlled Low Strength Materials (CLSMs). These materials typically have compressive strengths under 1200 psi.","declared_unit":"1 m3","pct50_gwp":"123.1396058 kgCO2e","pct30_gwp":"91.39695183

(high slump) and sets with no compaction. It is often used in tight or restricted access areas where placing and compacting fill is difficult. Applications include filling large voids such as abandoned underground storage tanks, basements, tunnels, mines, and sewers. It can also be used as paving sub-base, bridge abutment, and retaining wall backfill. Also called Controlled Density Fill (CDF) or Controlled Low Strength Materials (CLSMs).

(high slump) and sets with no compaction. It is often used in tight or restricted access areas where placing and compacting fill is difficult. Applications include filling large voids such as abandoned underground storage tanks, basements, tunnels, mines, and sewers. It can also be used as paving sub-base, bridge abutment, and retaining wall backfill. Also called Controlled Density Fill (CDF) or Controlled Low Strength Materials (CLSMs). These materials typically have compressive strengths under 1200 psi.","declared_unit":"1 m3","pct50_gwp":"123.1396058 kgCO2e","pct30_gwp":"91.39695183

(high slump) and sets with no compaction. It is often used in tight or restricted access areas where placing and compacting fill is difficult. Applications include filling large voids such as abandoned underground storage tanks, basements, tunnels, mines, and sewers. It can also be used as paving sub-base, bridge abutment, and retaining wall backfill. Also called Controlled Density Fill (CDF) or Controlled Low Strength Materials (CLSMs). These materials typically have compressive strengths under 1200 psi.","declared_unit":"1 m3","pct50_gwp":"123.1396058 kgCO2e","pct30_gwp":"91.39695183

(high slump) and sets with no compaction. It is often used in tight or restricted access areas where placing and compacting fill is difficult. Applications include filling large voids such as abandoned underground storage tanks, basements, tunnels, mines, and sewers. It can also be used as paving sub-base, bridge abutment, and retaining wall backfill. Also called Controlled Density Fill (CDF) or Controlled Low Strength Materials (CLSMs). These materials typically have compressive strengths under 1200 psi.","declared_unit":"1 m3","pct50_gwp":"123.1396058 kgCO2e","pct30_gwp":"91.39695183

(high slump) and sets with no compaction. It is often used in tight or restricted access areas where placing and compacting fill is difficult. Applications include filling large voids such as abandoned underground storage tanks, basements, tunnels, mines, and sewers. It can also be used as paving sub-base, bridge abutment, and retaining wall backfill. Also called Controlled Density Fill (CDF) or Controlled Low Strength Materials (CLSMs).

(high slump) and sets with no compaction. It is often used in tight or restricted access areas where placing and compacting fill is difficult. Applications include filling large voids such as abandoned underground storage tanks, basements, tunnels, mines, and sewers. It can also be used as paving sub-base, bridge abutment, and retaining wall backfill. Also called Controlled Density Fill (CDF) or Controlled Low Strength Materials (CLSMs). These materials typically have compressive strengths under 1200 psi.","declared_unit":"1 m3","pct50_gwp":"123.1396058 kgCO2e","pct30_gwp":"91.39695183

It can also be used as paving sub-base, bridge abutment, and retaining wall backfill. Also called Controlled Density Fill (CDF) or Controlled Low Strength Materials (CLSMs).

(high slump) and sets with no compaction. It is often used in tight or restricted access areas where placing and compacting fill is difficult. Applications include filling large voids such as abandoned underground storage tanks, basements, tunnels, mines, and sewers. It can also be used as paving sub-base, bridge abutment, and retaining wall backfill. Also called Controlled Density Fill (CDF) or Controlled Low Strength Materials (CLSMs). These materials typically have compressive strengths under 1200 psi.","declared_unit":"1 m3","pct50_gwp":"123.1396058 kgCO2e","pct30_gwp":"91.39695183

(high slump) and sets with no compaction. It is often used in tight or restricted access areas where placing and compacting fill is difficult. Applications include filling large voids such as abandoned underground storage tanks, basements, tunnels, mines, and sewers. It can also be used as paving sub-base, bridge abutment, and retaining wall backfill. Also called Controlled Density Fill (CDF) or Controlled Low Strength Materials (CLSMs).

(high slump) and sets with no compaction. It is often used in tight or restricted access areas where placing and compacting fill is difficult. Applications include filling large voids such as abandoned underground storage tanks, basements, tunnels, mines, and sewers. It can also be used as paving sub-base, bridge abutment, and retaining wall backfill. Also called Controlled Density Fill (CDF) or Controlled Low Strength Materials (CLSMs). These materials typically have compressive strengths under 1200 psi.","declared_unit":"1 m3","pct50_gwp":"123.1396058 kgCO2e","pct30_gwp":"91.39695183

(high slump) and sets with no compaction. It is often used in tight or restricted access areas where placing and compacting fill is difficult. Applications include filling large voids such as abandoned underground storage tanks, basements, tunnels, mines, and sewers. It can also be used as paving sub-base, bridge abutment, and retaining wall backfill. Also called Controlled Density Fill (CDF) or Controlled Low Strength Materials (CLSMs). These materials typically have compressive strengths under 1200 psi.","declared_unit":"1 m3","pct50_gwp":"123.1396058 kgCO2e","pct30_gwp":"91.39695183

(high slump) and sets with no compaction. It is often used in tight or restricted access areas where placing and compacting fill is difficult. Applications include filling large voids such as abandoned underground storage tanks, basements, tunnels, mines, and sewers. It can also be used as paving sub-base, bridge abutment, and retaining wall backfill. Also called Controlled Density Fill (CDF) or Controlled Low Strength Materials (CLSMs). These materials typically have compressive strengths under 1200 psi.","declared_unit":"1 m3","pct50_gwp":"123.1396058 kgCO2e","pct30_gwp":"91.39695183

(high slump) and sets with no compaction. It is often used in tight or restricted access areas where placing and compacting fill is difficult. Applications include filling large voids such as abandoned underground storage tanks, basements, tunnels, mines, and sewers. It can also be used as paving sub-base, bridge abutment, and retaining wall backfill. Also called Controlled Density Fill (CDF) or Controlled Low Strength Materials (CLSMs).

(high slump) and sets with no compaction. It is often used in tight or restricted access areas where placing and compacting fill is difficult. Applications include filling large voids such as abandoned underground storage tanks, basements, tunnels, mines, and sewers. It can also be used as paving sub-base, bridge abutment, and retaining wall backfill. Also called Controlled Density Fill (CDF) or Controlled Low Strength Materials (CLSMs). These materials typically have compressive strengths under 1200 psi.","declared_unit":"1 m3","pct50_gwp":"123.1396058 kgCO2e","pct30_gwp":"91.39695183

(high slump) and sets with no compaction. It is often used in tight or restricted access areas where placing and compacting fill is difficult. Applications include filling large voids such as abandoned underground storage tanks, basements, tunnels, mines, and sewers. It can also be used as paving sub-base, bridge abutment, and retaining wall backfill. Also called Controlled Density Fill (CDF) or Controlled Low Strength Materials (CLSMs).

(high slump) and sets with no compaction. It is often used in tight or restricted access areas where placing and compacting fill is difficult. Applications include filling large voids such as abandoned underground storage tanks, basements, tunnels, mines, and sewers. It can also be used as paving sub-base, bridge abutment, and retaining wall backfill. Also called Controlled Density Fill (CDF) or Controlled Low Strength Materials (CLSMs). These materials typically have compressive strengths under 1200 psi.","declared_unit":"1 m3","pct50_gwp":"123.1396058 kgCO2e","pct30_gwp":"91.39695183

(high slump) and sets with no compaction. It is often used in tight or restricted access areas where placing and compacting fill is difficult. Applications include filling large voids such as abandoned underground storage tanks, basements, tunnels, mines, and sewers. It can also be used as paving sub-base, bridge abutment, and retaining wall backfill. Also called Controlled Density Fill (CDF) or Controlled Low Strength Materials (CLSMs). These materials typically have compressive strengths under 1200 psi.","declared_unit":"1 m3","pct50_gwp":"123.1396058 kgCO2e","pct30_gwp":"91.39695183

(high slump) and sets with no compaction. It is often used in tight or restricted access areas where placing and compacting fill is difficult. Applications include filling large voids such as abandoned underground storage tanks, basements, tunnels, mines, and sewers. It can also be used as paving sub-base, bridge abutment, and retaining wall backfill. Also called Controlled Density Fill (CDF) or Controlled Low Strength Materials (CLSMs).

(high slump) and sets with no compaction. It is often used in tight or restricted access areas where placing and compacting fill is difficult. Applications include filling large voids such as abandoned underground storage tanks, basements, tunnels, mines, and sewers. It can also be used as paving sub-base, bridge abutment, and retaining wall backfill. Also called Controlled Density Fill (CDF) or Controlled Low Strength Materials (CLSMs). These materials typically have compressive strengths under 1200 psi.","declared_unit":"1 m3","pct50_gwp":"123.1396058 kgCO2e","pct30_gwp":"91.39695183

(high slump) and sets with no compaction. It is often used in tight or restricted access areas where placing and compacting fill is difficult. Applications include filling large voids such as abandoned underground storage tanks, basements, tunnels, mines, and sewers. It can also be used as paving sub-base, bridge abutment, and retaining wall backfill. Also called Controlled Density Fill (CDF) or Controlled Low Strength Materials (CLSMs). These materials typically have compressive strengths under 1200 psi.","declared_unit":"1 m3","pct50_gwp":"123.1396058 kgCO2e","pct30_gwp":"91.39695183

It can also be used as paving sub-base, bridge abutment, and retaining wall backfill. Also called Controlled Density Fill (CDF) or Controlled Low Strength Materials (CLSMs).

(high slump) and sets with no compaction. It is often used in tight or restricted access areas where placing and compacting fill is difficult. Applications include filling large voids such as abandoned underground storage tanks, basements, tunnels, mines, and sewers. It can also be used as paving sub-base, bridge abutment, and retaining wall backfill. Also called Controlled Density Fill (CDF) or Controlled Low Strength Materials (CLSMs). These materials typically have compressive strengths under 1200 psi.","declared_unit":"1 m3","pct50_gwp":"123.1396058 kgCO2e","pct30_gwp":"91.39695183

(high slump) and sets with no compaction. It is often used in tight or restricted access areas where placing and compacting fill is difficult. Applications include filling large voids such as abandoned underground storage tanks, basements, tunnels, mines, and sewers. It can also be used as paving sub-base, bridge abutment, and retaining wall backfill. Also called Controlled Density Fill (CDF) or Controlled Low Strength Materials (CLSMs). These materials typically have compressive strengths under 1200 psi.","declared_unit":"1 m3","pct50_gwp":"123.1396058 kgCO2e","pct30_gwp":"91.39695183

(high slump) and sets with no compaction. It is often used in tight or restricted access areas where placing and compacting fill is difficult. Applications include filling large voids such as abandoned underground storage tanks, basements, tunnels, mines, and sewers. It can also be used as paving sub-base, bridge abutment, and retaining wall backfill. Also called Controlled Density Fill (CDF) or Controlled Low Strength Materials (CLSMs).

(high slump) and sets with no compaction. It is often used in tight or restricted access areas where placing and compacting fill is difficult. Applications include filling large voids such as abandoned underground storage tanks, basements, tunnels, mines, and sewers. It can also be used as paving sub-base, bridge abutment, and retaining wall backfill. Also called Controlled Density Fill (CDF) or Controlled Low Strength Materials (CLSMs). These materials typically have compressive strengths under 1200 psi.","declared_unit":"1 m3","pct50_gwp":"123.1396058 kgCO2e","pct30_gwp":"91.39695183

(high slump) and sets with no compaction. It is often used in tight or restricted access areas where placing and compacting fill is difficult. Applications include filling large voids such as abandoned underground storage tanks, basements, tunnels, mines, and sewers. It can also be used as paving sub-base, bridge abutment, and retaining wall backfill. Also called Controlled Density Fill (CDF) or Controlled Low Strength Materials (CLSMs).

(high slump) and sets with no compaction. It is often used in tight or restricted access areas where placing and compacting fill is difficult. Applications include filling large voids such as abandoned underground storage tanks, basements, tunnels, mines, and sewers. It can also be used as paving sub-base, bridge abutment, and retaining wall backfill. Also called Controlled Density Fill (CDF) or Controlled Low Strength Materials (CLSMs). These materials typically have compressive strengths under 1200 psi.","declared_unit":"1 m3","pct50_gwp":"123.1396058 kgCO2e","pct30_gwp":"91.39695183

It can also be used as paving sub-base, bridge abutment, and retaining wall backfill. Also called Controlled Density Fill (CDF) or Controlled Low Strength Materials (CLSMs).

(high slump) and sets with no compaction. It is often used in tight or restricted access areas where placing and compacting fill is difficult. Applications include filling large voids such as abandoned underground storage tanks, basements, tunnels, mines, and sewers. It can also be used as paving sub-base, bridge abutment, and retaining wall backfill. Also called Controlled Density Fill (CDF) or Controlled Low Strength Materials (CLSMs). These materials typically have compressive strengths under 1200 psi.","declared_unit":"1 m3","pct50_gwp":"123.1396058 kgCO2e","pct30_gwp":"91.39695183

It can also be used as paving sub-base, bridge abutment, and retaining wall backfill. Also called Controlled Density Fill (CDF) or Controlled Low Strength Materials (CLSMs).

(high slump) and sets with no compaction. It is often used in tight or restricted access areas where placing and compacting fill is difficult. Applications include filling large voids such as abandoned underground storage tanks, basements, tunnels, mines, and sewers. It can also be used as paving sub-base, bridge abutment, and retaining wall backfill. Also called Controlled Density Fill (CDF) or Controlled Low Strength Materials (CLSMs). These materials typically have compressive strengths under 1200 psi.","declared_unit":"1 m3","pct50_gwp":"123.1396058 kgCO2e","pct30_gwp":"91.39695183

(high slump) and sets with no compaction. It is often used in tight or restricted access areas where placing and compacting fill is difficult. Applications include filling large voids such as abandoned underground storage tanks, basements, tunnels, mines, and sewers. It can also be used as paving sub-base, bridge abutment, and retaining wall backfill. Also called Controlled Density Fill (CDF) or Controlled Low Strength Materials (CLSMs).

(high slump) and sets with no compaction. It is often used in tight or restricted access areas where placing and compacting fill is difficult. Applications include filling large voids such as abandoned underground storage tanks, basements, tunnels, mines, and sewers. It can also be used as paving sub-base, bridge abutment, and retaining wall backfill. Also called Controlled Density Fill (CDF) or Controlled Low Strength Materials (CLSMs). These materials typically have compressive strengths under 1200 psi.","declared_unit":"1 m3","pct50_gwp":"123.1396058 kgCO2e","pct30_gwp":"91.39695183

It is often used in tight or restricted access areas where placing and compacting fill is difficult. Applications include filling large voids such as abandoned underground storage tanks, basements, tunnels, mines, and sewers. It can also be used as paving sub-base, bridge abutment, and retaining wall backfill. Also called Controlled Density Fill (CDF) or Controlled Low Strength Materials (CLSMs).
