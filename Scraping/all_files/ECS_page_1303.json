These glass wool fibres are formed into a “mineral wool mat” consisting of a soft, airy structure The best natural insulator on earth is dry immobile air at 10°C: its thermal conductivity factor, expressed in λ, is 0.025 W/(m.K) (watts per meter Kelvin degree). The thermal conductivity of glass mineral wool is close to immobile air as its λ (Lambda) varies from 0.032 W/(m.K) for the most efficient to 0.044 W/(m.K) for the least. The glass mineral wool products have an entangled, porous structure: This enables air to become trapped in the pores of the material providing exceptional thermal properties. Furthermore, its porous and elastic structure absorbs noise in the air and offers acoustic correction inside premises. Incombustible by nature, Isover glass mineral wool does not fuel fire or propagate flames. Glass mineral wool insulation usage is extensive, ranging from use in building insulation (loft, cavity walls) to technical insulation (Industrial facilities, Marine & offshore). It ensures a high level of comfort, lowers energy costs, minimizes carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, prevents heat loss through pitched roofs, walls, floors, pipes and boilers, reduces noise pollution and protects homes and industrial facilities from the risk of fire. Moreover, Isover insulation allows substantial weight savings for marine applications. The glass mineral wool products generated at Saint - Gobain Isover UK have an average building lifespan of 60 years, or as long as the insulated building component is part of the building.

Insulation manufactures glass mineral wool insulation products. They are available in the form of slabs or rolls, and also boards. The density for glass mineral wool rangs from 10 to 85 kg/m³. In general, glass mineral wool consists of >= 92.5% inert material. The inert part is made of recycled glass (external cullet, up to 80% of the composition) and mainly sand and dolomite. The remaining <= 7.5% are made of binder components. At Knauf Insulation, the binder used for the GMW products is the ECOSE binder whose origin is plant starch. GMW 035-034 slabs are products unfaced or faced with a glass veil, and they are used for their thermal, acoustical and fire characteristics. A representative product out of a particular group of produts was selected for the calculation. Application Main applications for GMW 035-034 slabs are in external walls: ventilated façade, cavity wall or timber frame. For the applications and use national regulations apply, in Germany the /Allgemeine bauaufsichtliche Zulassung Z-23.15-1461/ (building inspection approval) issued by the Deutsches Institut für Bautechnik (DIBt), Berlin. For the placing on the market of construction products in the European Union and EFTA /Regulation (EU) No 305/2011/ applies. The products need a Declaration of performance (DoP) taking into consideration the harmonized product standard /EN 13162/ and the CEmark /Regulation (EC) No 765/2008/.
