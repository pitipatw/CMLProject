This enables the glass to react when exposed to radiant heat and fire in order to protect life and property in living places for the specific time frame. By adding a laminated safety glass including a PVB layer, fall-through protection in the event of breakage of the CONTRAFLAM unit can be included as an option.

Steel can be readily adapted for various uses. It allows asset owners to modify existing structures to cater for future uses and tenants, as well as extending the structure’s lifespan beyond its initial intent.Steel is a 100% recyclable material, with no loss in material strength or quality.

Steel can be readily adapted for various uses. It allows asset owners to modify existing structures to cater for future uses and tenants, as well as extending the structure’s lifespan beyond its initial intent.Steel is a 100% recyclable material, with no loss in material strength or quality.  Modern design techniques and the use of higher strength grades can also reduce the mass of steel used in
