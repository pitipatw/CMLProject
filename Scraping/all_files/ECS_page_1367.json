stone wool acoustic tiles are traditionally made from volcanic rock (typically basalt or dolomite), an increasing proportion of recycled material, and a low percentage of binder (in Rockfon acoustic tiles this is around 3-4%). The essential component of Rockfon tiles are stone wool fibres, which are monofilament synthetic mineral fibres of non-crystalline structure extracted from a silicate melt. The products described in this EPD are produced in the form of tiles in the density range from 70 up to 175 kg/m³. The products are supplied in thicknesses of 12 up to 160 mm. The acoustic tiles can have a glass fibre fleece facing and can be coated with water-based dispersion paint. Details for the environmental impacts of this type of facing can be found on the first page of the annex. The 2 additional facing of aluminium laminate may be applicable for some products. The environmental impacts of aluminium laminate are presented on the second page of the annex. Product-specific environmental impacts are compiled by applying the relevant scaling factor (listed in the table below) in the Product Specific Scaling formula. Product Specific Scaling Formula: Environmental Impact per m2 product X-with facing = Environmental Impact reference product*scaling factor+Environmental Impact facing material. Please note that the scaling factors give the precise amount of material needed to produce the other product types. Environmental Product Declaration ROCKWOOL ROCKFON GmbH - Ceiling Tiles For the placing on the market of the product in the European Union/European Free Trade Association (EU/EFTA) (with the exception of Switzerland) Regulation (EU) No. 305/2011 (CPR) applies.

stone wool acoustic tiles are traditionally made from volcanic rock (typically basalt or dolomite), an increasing proportion of recycled material, and a low percentage of binder (in Rockfon acoustic tiles this is around 3-4%). The essential component of Rockfon tiles are stone wool fibres, which are monofilament synthetic mineral fibres of non-crystalline structure extracted from a silicate melt. The products described in this EPD are produced in the form of tiles in the density range from 70 up to 175 kg/m³. The products are supplied in thicknesses of 12 up to 160 mm. The acoustic tiles can have a glass fibre fleece facing and can be coated with water-based dispersion paint. Details for the environmental impacts of this type of facing can be found on the first page of the annex. The 2 additional facing of aluminium laminate may be applicable for some products. The environmental impacts of aluminium laminate are presented on the second page of the annex. Product-specific environmental impacts are compiled by applying the relevant scaling factor (listed in the table below) in the Product Specific Scaling formula. Product Specific Scaling Formula: Environmental Impact per m2 product X-with facing = Environmental Impact reference product*scaling factor+Environmental Impact facing material. Please note that the scaling factors give the precise amount of material needed to produce the other product types. Environmental Product Declaration ROCKWOOL ROCKFON GmbH - Ceiling Tiles For the placing on the market of the product in the European Union/European Free Trade Association (EU/EFTA) (with the exception of Switzerland) Regulation (EU) No. 305/2011 (CPR) applies.

description and description of use:\nThis Environmental Product Declaration (ED) describes the environmental impact of 1 m of acoustic ceiling with the\nintended use to increase sound absorption in a room to create a better indoor environment.\nThis Environmental Product Declaration (ED) are valid for products produced in the Eurocoustic productior plants in France\nwith a high-quality stone wool in different densities and thicknesses. The mineral wool is covered with a painted or woven\nsurface layer and cut into panels of different sizes and edge designs. The edges are painted and the panels are packed\nin cardboard boxes.\nThe structure of stone wool gives the material excellent sound energy absorption properties. Sound absorption is the main\nfunction of acoustic stone wool panels. The panels are a so sable, and easy to handle and cut.\nAcoustic stone wool panels are commonly used in schools, offices, health care facilities and production premises where\nthere is a need for noise reduction to improve the wo-king environment. The decrease in reverberation time, sound pressure\nlevel and other acoustic parameters are related to the amount of panels used in the room as well as the placement of the\npanels. The acoustic panels need no maintenance and do not age. They can last as long as the building itself. For aesthetic\nreasons, normal room surace cleaning is advised.","open_xpd_uuid":"ec3zt3hy","resilient_flooring_thickness":null,"masonry_cement_astm_c91_type":null,"cmu_glass_powder_containing":null,"steel_rebar_diameter_min":null,"density":null,"access_flooring_finish_material":null,"concrete_compressive_strength_other_d":null,"wall_base_material":null,"gwp":"5.96

Interiors produces a family of X-technology wet felted acoustical ceiling panels at its Cloquet, MN, facility having various light reflectance, noise reduction, and attenuation specifications with various levels of post-consumer/industrial recycled content. The X-technology wet felted production line at the Cloquet facility employs a wet-felted technology in the 2 production of acoustical ceiling panels. X-technology wet felted acoustical ceiling panels contain mostly mineral wool, starch and latex. In smaller amounts, other raw materials used in the panel forming process include flocculants, biocides and de-foamer. The finishing and packaging unit processes are dominated by the use of water-based paint, which contains ingredients such as calcium carbonate, clay, latex, titanium dioxide (TiO2) and other chemicals. Shrink-wrap and corrugated strip are used as packing materials. USG Interiors, LLC also produces a family of grid products at its Westlake, OH, Cartersville, GA, Oakville, ON, Canada and Stockton, CA facilities. This family of grid products coordinates with USG Ceilings Mars ClimaPlus panels and includes 8 grid profiles including DX/DXL, DXW, DXT, DXF, DXFF and DXI. Each profile is available in Intermediate Duty and Heavy Duty weight. Grid production encompasses the third-party production of the hot-dipped galvanized steel coils, transport of these coils to USG fabrication facilities where the steel coil is cleaned, coated (optional depending on intended purpose) and slit and optionally transported to additional production facilities where the coated steel is formed into finished grid components. These finished grid components are then packaged in cardboard boxes.

Interiors produces a family of cast acoustical ceiling panels at its Walworth, WI, facility having various light reflectance, noise reduction, and attenuation specifications with various levels of post-consumer/industrial recycled content. The production line at the Walworth facility employs cast technology in the production of acoustical ceiling panels. Cast acoustical ceiling panels contain mostly mineral wool, starch and clay. The finishing and packaging unit processes are dominated by the use of water-based paint, which contains the following ingredients: calcium carbonate, clay, latex, titanium dioxide (TiO2), other chemicals. Shrink-wrap and corrugated strip are used as packing materials. USG Interiors, LLC also produces a family of grid products at its Westlake, OH, Cartersville, GA, Oakville, ON, Canada and Stockton, CA facilities. This family of grid products coordinates with USG Ceilings: Frost Firecode, Sandrift Firecode, Glacier Firecode panels and includes grid profile DXL. DXL is available in Intermediate Duty and Heavy Duty weight. Grid production encompasses the third-party production of the hot-dipped galvanized steel coils, transport of these coils to USG fabrication facilities where the steel coil is cleaned, coated (optional depending on intended purpose) and slit and optionally transported to additional production facilities where the coated steel is formed into finished grid components. These finished grid components are then packaged in cardboard boxes.","open_xpd_uuid":"ec3p1xr2","resilient_flooring_thickness":null,"masonry_cement_astm_c91_type":null,"cmu_glass_powder_containing":null,"steel_rebar_diameter_min":null,"density":"24.5

high-quality stone wool in different densities and thicknesses. The mineral wool is covered with a painted or woven\nsurface layer and cut into panels of different sizes and edge designs. The edges are painted and the panels are packed\nin cardboard boxes.\nThe structure of stone wool gives the material excellent sound energy absorption properties. Sound absorption is the main\nfunction of acoustic stone wool panels. The panels are a so scble, cra easy to handle and cut\nAcoustic stone wool panels are commonly used in schools, offices, health care facilities and production premises where\nthere is a need for noise reduction to improve the wo *king environment, The cecrease in reverberation time, sound pressure\nlevel and other acoustic parcmeters are related to the amount of panels used in the room as well as the placement of the\npanels.

Environmental Product Declaration (EPD) describes  the environmental impact of 1m²of acoustic ceiling w ith the intended use  to increase  sound absorption in a room to create  a better indoor environment.This  Environmental  Product  Declaration  (EPD)are  valid  for  products  produced  in  Ecophon production  plants in  Sw eden,  Denmark,  Poland  and  Finland  w ith a  high-quality glass  w ool indifferent  densities  and thicknesses. The  glass w ool is covered  w ith a paintedor w oven surface layer  and cut  into panels  of different  sizes and  edge  designs.  The  edges  are  painted and  the panels  are packed  in cardboard boxes.The  structure  of glass w ool gives the material excellent  sound energy  absorption properties. Sound absorption is the main function of acoustic glass w ool panels. The  panels  are also light, stable, and easy  to handle and cut. Acoustic  glass w ool panels are  commonly used in schools, offices, health care  facilities and production premises  w here there  is a need for noise reduction  to improve the w orking environment. The  decrease  in reverberation  time, sound pressure  level and other acoustic parameters  are related  to the amount of panels  used in the room as w ell as the placement  of the panels.The  acoustic  panels need  no maintenance  and do not age. They  can  last as long as the building itself. For aesthetic  reasons,  normal room surface  cleaning is advised.","open_xpd_uuid":"ec3btmfg","resilient_flooring_thickness":null,"masonry_cement_astm_c91_type":null,"cmu_glass_powder_containing":null,"steel_rebar_diameter_min":null,"density":"7870 kg /

Environmental Product Declaration (EPD) describes  the environmental impact of 1m²of acoustic ceiling w ith the intended use  to increase  sound absorption in a room to create  a better indoor environment.This  Environmental  Product  Declaration  (EPD)are  valid  for  products  produced  in  Ecophon production  plants in  Sw eden,  Denmark,  Poland  and  Finland  w ith a  high-quality glass  w ool indifferent  densities  and thicknesses. The  glass w ool is covered  w ith a paintedor w oven surface layer  and cut  into panels  of different  sizes and  edge  designs.  The  edges  are  painted and  the panels  are packed  in cardboard boxes.The  structure  of glass w ool gives the material excellent  sound energy  absorption properties. Sound absorption is the main function of acoustic glass w ool panels. The  panels  are also light, stable, and easy  to handle and cut. Acoustic  glass w ool panels are  commonly used in schools, offices, health care  facilities and production premises  w here there  is a need for noise reduction  to improve the w orking environment. The  decrease  in reverberation  time, sound pressure  level and other acoustic parameters  are related  to the amount of panels  used in the room as w ell as the placement  of the panels.The  acoustic  panels need  no maintenance  and do not age. They  can  last as long as the building itself. For aesthetic  reasons,  normal room surface  cleaning is advised.","open_xpd_uuid":"ec3707ga","resilient_flooring_thickness":null,"masonry_cement_astm_c91_type":null,"cmu_glass_powder_containing":null,"steel_rebar_diameter_min":null,"density":"7870 kg /

Environmental Product Declaration (EPD) describes  the environmental impact of 1m²of acoustic ceiling w ith the intended use  to increase  sound absorption in a room to create  a better indoor environment.This  Environmental  Product  Declaration  (EPD)are  valid  for  products  produced  in  Ecophon production  plants in  Sw eden,  Denmark,  Poland  and  Finland  w ith a  high-quality glass  w ool indifferent  densities  and thicknesses. The  glass w ool is covered  w ith a paintedor w oven surface layer  and cut  into panels  of different  sizes and  edge  designs.  The  edges  are  painted and  the panels  are packed  in cardboard boxes.The  structure  of glass w ool gives the material excellent  sound energy  absorption properties. Sound absorption is the main function of acoustic glass w ool panels. The  panels  are also light, stable, and easy  to handle and cut. Acoustic  glass w ool panels are  commonly used in schools, offices, health care  facilities and production premises  w here there  is a need for noise reduction  to improve the w orking environment. The  decrease  in reverberation  time, sound pressure  level and other acoustic parameters  are related  to the amount of panels  used in the room as w ell as the placement  of the panels.The  acoustic  panels need  no maintenance  and do not age. They  can  last as long as the building itself. For aesthetic  reasons,  normal room surface  cleaning is advised.","open_xpd_uuid":"ec3n1h4n","resilient_flooring_thickness":null,"masonry_cement_astm_c91_type":null,"cmu_glass_powder_containing":null,"steel_rebar_diameter_min":null,"density":"7870 kg /

of wool: 15mm. Surfacing: Glass veil + paint + glue (316 g/m2)\n\nThis Environmental Product Declaration (EPD) for the Advantage product family describes the environmental impact of 1m² of acoustic ceiling with the intended use to increase sound absorption in a room to create a better indoor environment. The scope for this EPD is cradle-to-grave. The production site of Saint-Gobain Ecophon (Sweden) produces acoustic ceilings and wall absorbers based on glass wool with a plant based binder in different densities and thicknesses. The glass wool is covered with a painted or woven surface layer and cut into panels of different sizes and edge designs. Acoustic panels made of glass wool are commonly used in schools, offices, health care facilities and production premises where there is a need for noise reduction to improve the working environment. The decrease in reverberation time, sound pressure level and other acoustic parameters are related to the amount of panels used in the room as well as the placement of the panels. The acoustic panels need no maintenance and do not age. They can last as long as the building itself. For aesthetic reasons, normal room surface cleaning is advised.","open_xpd_uuid":"ec3snq1w","resilient_flooring_thickness":null,"masonry_cement_astm_c91_type":null,"cmu_glass_powder_containing":null,"steel_rebar_diameter_min":null,"density":"60 kg / m3","access_flooring_finish_material":null,"concrete_compressive_strength_other_d":null,"wall_base_material":null,"gwp":"2.53 kgCO2e","vrt":null,"sku":null,"asphalt_min_temperature":null,"fnd":null,"cable_trays_material":null,"pdu_outlets":null,"nsf347":null,"sog":null,"recommended_application":null,"cladding_r_value":null,"ceiling_panel_nrc":0.95,"plc":null,"asphalt_aggregate_size_max":null,"toughened":null,"concrete_co2_entrain":null,"thickness":null,"abuse_resistant":null,"steel_bar_elongation":null,"asphalt_gtr":null,"floor_box_cover":null,"cladding_insulating_material":null,"name":"Ecophon Advantage A","height":null,"cmu_weight_classification":null,"manufacturing_image":null,"energy_source":null,"flat_glass_panes_thickness":null,"cmu_smoothface":null,"residential_only":null,"wall_tile":null,"is_failed":false,"large_format":null,"product_usage_image_crop_area":null,"access_flooring_adjustable_height":null,"electrochromic":null,"mosaic_tile":null,"access_flooring_rolling_load_10_pass":null,"steel_composition":null,"manufacturer":{"horizontal_logo":null,"parent":null,"postal_code":"19200","primary_activity_operator":false,"email_extensions":null,"gwp_contact":null,"latitude":53.31307,"primary_activity_digitization_qa":false,"longitude":-2.65748,"my_capabilities":null,"pilot_all_employees":false,"primary_activity_design":false,"iso9001_certified":null,"primary_activity_performance_standards_issuer":false,"iso14001_certified":null,"web_domain":"isover.com","cqd_sync_server_from":null,"primary_activity_verifier":false,"address":"Runcorn (Whitehouse Industrial Estate)","name":"Isover Saint-Gobain","owner":null,"tax_id":null,"created_on":"2019-12-23T11:46:05.534664Z","primary_activity_education":false,"user_group_collaborators":null,"primary_activity_sustainability_consulting":false,"alt_names":["Saint-Gobain Isover","Kimmco-Isover Saint Gobain","Saint-Gobain Argentina S.A. - Div.

of wool: 15 mm. Surfacing: Glass veil + paint + glue (0,485 g/m2)\nThis Environmental Product Declaration (EPD) for the Gedina product family describes the environmental impact of 1m² of acoustic ceiling with the intended use to increase sound absorption in a room to create a better indoor environment. The scope for this EPD is cradle-to-grave.The production site of Saint-Gobain Ecophon (Sweden) produces acoustic ceilings and wall absorbers based on glass wool with a plant based binder in different densities and thicknesses. The glass wool is covered with a painted or woven surface layer and cut into panels of different sizes and edge designs.Acoustic panels made of glass wool are commonly used in schools, offices, health care facilities and production premises where there is a need for noise reduction to improve the working environment. The decrease in reverberation time, sound pressure level and other acoustic parameters are related to the amount of panels used in the room as well as the placement of the panels.","open_xpd_uuid":"ec3bmjsh","resilient_flooring_thickness":null,"masonry_cement_astm_c91_type":null,"cmu_glass_powder_containing":null,"steel_rebar_diameter_min":null,"density":"2320 kg / m3","access_flooring_finish_material":null,"concrete_compressive_strength_other_d":null,"wall_base_material":null,"gwp":"2.86 kgCO2e","vrt":null,"sku":null,"asphalt_min_temperature":null,"fnd":null,"cable_trays_material":null,"pdu_outlets":null,"nsf347":null,"sog":null,"recommended_application":null,"cladding_r_value":null,"ceiling_panel_nrc":0.95,"plc":null,"asphalt_aggregate_size_max":null,"toughened":null,"concrete_co2_entrain":null,"thickness":null,"abuse_resistant":null,"steel_bar_elongation":null,"asphalt_gtr":null,"floor_box_cover":null,"cladding_insulating_material":null,"name":"Ecophon Gedina A","height":null,"cmu_weight_classification":null,"manufacturing_image":null,"energy_source":null,"flat_glass_panes_thickness":null,"cmu_smoothface":null,"residential_only":null,"wall_tile":null,"is_failed":false,"large_format":null,"product_usage_image_crop_area":null,"access_flooring_adjustable_height":null,"electrochromic":null,"mosaic_tile":null,"access_flooring_rolling_load_10_pass":null,"steel_composition":null,"manufacturer":{"horizontal_logo":null,"parent":null,"postal_code":"19200","primary_activity_operator":false,"email_extensions":null,"gwp_contact":null,"latitude":53.31307,"primary_activity_digitization_qa":false,"longitude":-2.65748,"my_capabilities":null,"pilot_all_employees":false,"primary_activity_design":false,"iso9001_certified":null,"primary_activity_performance_standards_issuer":false,"iso14001_certified":null,"web_domain":"isover.com","cqd_sync_server_from":null,"primary_activity_verifier":false,"address":"Runcorn (Whitehouse Industrial Estate)","name":"Isover Saint-Gobain","owner":null,"tax_id":null,"created_on":"2019-12-23T11:46:05.534664Z","primary_activity_education":false,"user_group_collaborators":null,"primary_activity_sustainability_consulting":false,"alt_names":["Saint-Gobain Isover","Kimmco-Isover Saint Gobain","Saint-Gobain Argentina S.A. - Div.

of wool: 15mm. Surfacing: Glass veil + paint + glue (485 g/m2).\n\nThis Environmental Product Declaration (EPD®) describes the environmental impact of 1m² of acoustic ceiling  with  the  intended  use  to  increase  sound  absorption  in  a  room  to  create  a  better  indoor environment. This EPD® isvalid for products produced in Ecophon production plant inside ISOVER -Saint-Gobain do Brasilin Santo Amaro (São Paulo/ BR). The production uses natural and abundant raw materials (sand), using  fusion  and  fiberizing  techniques  to  produce a high-quality  glass  wool  in  different  densities  and thicknesses. The glass wool is covered with a painted or woven surface layer and cut into panels of different sizes and edge designs. The edges are painted and the panels are packed in cardboard boxes. The  structure  of  glass  wool  gives  the  material  excellent  sound  energy  absorption  properties.  Sound absorption is the main function of acoustic glass wool panels. The panels are also light, stable and easy to handle and cut. Acoustic glass wool panels are commonly used in schools, offices, health care facilities and production premises where there is a need for noise reduction to improve the working environment. The decrease in reverberation time, sound pressure level and other acoustic parameters are related to the amount of panels used in the room as well as the placement of the panels. The acoustic panels need no maintenance and do not age. They can last as long as the building itself. For aesthetic reasons, normal room surface cleaning is advised.","open_xpd_uuid":"ec3h2xmx","resilient_flooring_thickness":null,"masonry_cement_astm_c91_type":null,"cmu_glass_powder_containing":null,"steel_rebar_diameter_min":null,"density":"60 kg / m3","access_flooring_finish_material":null,"concrete_compressive_strength_other_d":null,"wall_base_material":null,"gwp":"2.86 kgCO2e","vrt":null,"sku":null,"asphalt_min_temperature":null,"fnd":null,"cable_trays_material":null,"pdu_outlets":null,"nsf347":null,"sog":null,"recommended_application":null,"cladding_r_value":null,"ceiling_panel_nrc":0.9,"plc":null,"asphalt_aggregate_size_max":null,"toughened":null,"concrete_co2_entrain":null,"thickness":null,"abuse_resistant":null,"steel_bar_elongation":null,"asphalt_gtr":null,"floor_box_cover":null,"cladding_insulating_material":null,"name":"Ecophon Sombra A","height":null,"cmu_weight_classification":null,"manufacturing_image":null,"energy_source":null,"flat_glass_panes_thickness":null,"cmu_smoothface":null,"residential_only":null,"wall_tile":null,"is_failed":false,"large_format":null,"product_usage_image_crop_area":null,"access_flooring_adjustable_height":null,"electrochromic":null,"mosaic_tile":null,"access_flooring_rolling_load_10_pass":null,"steel_composition":null,"manufacturer":{"horizontal_logo":null,"parent":null,"postal_code":"19200","primary_activity_operator":false,"email_extensions":null,"gwp_contact":null,"latitude":53.31307,"primary_activity_digitization_qa":false,"longitude":-2.65748,"my_capabilities":null,"pilot_all_employees":false,"primary_activity_design":false,"iso9001_certified":null,"primary_activity_performance_standards_issuer":false,"iso14001_certified":null,"web_domain":"isover.com","cqd_sync_server_from":null,"primary_activity_verifier":false,"address":"Runcorn (Whitehouse Industrial Estate)","name":"Isover Saint-Gobain","owner":null,"tax_id":null,"created_on":"2019-12-23T11:46:05.534664Z","primary_activity_education":false,"user_group_collaborators":null,"primary_activity_sustainability_consulting":false,"alt_names":["Saint-Gobain Isover","Kimmco-Isover Saint Gobain","Saint-Gobain Argentina S.A. - Div.

is a sound-absorbent system for use on both walls and ceilings, manufactured using MDF boards as core material. MDF panels are produced from softwood beech fibers which are glued and mixed with a melamine-ureaformaldheyde resin as a synthetic binder. The MDF surface finishes can be raw, melamine, veneer or lacquered. The rear of the panels can be covered with a sound-absorbent non-woven fabric layer. The high performance levels are achieved thanks to research into the theory of Helmholtz resonators and sound dissipation using porous textures. 4akustik® combines excellent soundabsorption performance with the highest health and safety standards. The panel, in its EC-certified version, classed as “B-s1,d0” for its reaction to fire. The 4akustik® panel products are fabricated with various perforation or groove patterns and configurations.","open_xpd_uuid":"ec37ungg","resilient_flooring_thickness":null,"masonry_cement_astm_c91_type":null,"cmu_glass_powder_containing":null,"steel_rebar_diameter_min":null,"density":"590 kg

Basic Acoustical Ceiling Panels and \"F\" Fissured™ Basic Acoustical Ceiling Panels are easy-to-clean, heavily textured panels that have the durability and noise reduction qualities to be a top choice to grace ceilings in an array of locations. They resist \"breathing\" (air passing through the surface), staying cleaner longer. Frost™ Basic Acoustical Ceiling Panels are light textured panels that provide an excellent combination of NRC and CAC. Paired with their high impact resistance, these panels combination of practicality and durability make them an ideal choice for a number of settings. The cast family of products covered by this EPD consist of a mineral wool/starch/filler basemat textured to achieve different aesthetic surfaces. These products generally fall under ASTM E1264 Section 5.2 designation as Type III - Mineral base with painted finish and Form 1 - Nodular.

Basic Acoustical Ceiling Panels and \"F\" Fissured™ Basic Acoustical Ceiling Panels are easy-to-clean, heavily textured panels that have the durability and noise reduction qualities to be a top choice to grace ceilings in an array of locations. They resist \"breathing\" (air passing through the surface), staying cleaner longer. Frost™ Basic Acoustical Ceiling Panels are light textured panels that provide an excellent combination of NRC and CAC. Paired with their high impact resistance, these panels combination of practicality and durability make them an ideal choice for a number of settings. The cast family of products covered by this EPD consist of a mineral wool/starch/filler basemat textured to achieve different aesthetic surfaces. These products generally fall under ASTM E1264 Section 5.2 designation as Type III - Mineral base with painted finish and Form 1 - Nodular.

900 Polynode is an adjustable nodal ceiling system used to create multi-faceted ceiling designs. The Polynodal 900 system meets the demand of increasingly varied and complex ceiling surfaces in modern building design. Simple equilateral triangle tiles can create a near infinite variety of polyhedral ceiling forms. Grid suspension with threaded rod and node plate which allows +/- 125mm adjustment from adjacent node (standard system). Highly complex geometrical surfaces can be installed using standard components, simply by adjusting the vertical position of the node. Corner anchor points suspend tiles which can be adjusted to create a free form ceiling. Our patent-pending nodal system can also be used to transition from ceiling to wall. Standard modules are mounted on grid with 866mm centres and standard nodes are mounted every 1000mm. Standard tiles are triangular as standard (980mmon all sides). Each meter square (M2) consists of 2.4 tiles. Bespoke sizes can be manufactured to suit client/project requirement and can be plain or perforated to meet acoustic requirements.

stone wool acoustic tiles are traditionally made from volcanic rock (typically basalt or dolomite), an increasing proportion of recycled material, and a low percentage of binder (in Rockfon acoustic tiles this is around 3-4%). The essential component of Rockfon tiles are stone wool fibres, which are monofilament synthetic mineral fibres of non-crystalline structure extracted from a silicate melt. The products described in this EPD are produced in the form of tiles in the density range from 70 up to 175 kg/m³. The products are supplied in thicknesses of 12 up to 160 mm. The acoustic tiles can have a glass fibre fleece facing and can be coated with water-based dispersion paint. Details for the environmental impacts of this type of facing can be found on the first page of the annex. The 2 additional facing of aluminium laminate may be applicable for some products. The environmental impacts of aluminium laminate are presented on the second page of the annex. Product-specific environmental impacts are compiled by applying the relevant scaling factor (listed in the table below) in the Product Specific Scaling formula. Product Specific Scaling Formula: Environmental Impact per m2 product X-with facing = Environmental Impact reference product*scaling factor+Environmental Impact facing material. Please note that the scaling factors give the precise amount of material needed to produce the other product types. Environmental Product Declaration ROCKWOOL ROCKFON GmbH - Ceiling Tiles For the placing on the market of the product in the European Union/European Free Trade Association (EU/EFTA) (with the exception of Switzerland) Regulation (EU) No. 305/2011 (CPR) applies.
