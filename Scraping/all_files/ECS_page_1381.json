In practice, all energy flows are calculated from the detailed environmental accounting system and the weight of the materials are determined from adequate bills of materials, including also the packaging solution. The pultrusion process starts with racks or creels holding rolls of doffs of fiber roving. The PUR resin is a mixture of isocyanate and polyol which is injected directly into the die where the fiber reinforcement becomes fully impregnated. As the resin rich fiber exits the resin impregnation system, the un-cured composite material is guided through a series of tooling. Once the resin impregnated fiber is organized and removed of excess resin, the composite will pass through a heated steel die. Precisely machined and often chromed, the die is heated to a constant temperature, and has several zones of temperature

It is produced by depositing an enamel pattern to one side of the glass, through a textile screen; OPALIT EVOLUTION is a translucent toughened enamelled glass produced by applying a layer of translucent enamel; PICTUREit is a digital printed glass, using enamels for the colors.The new enamels are of the same nature as the glass itself. They are lead-free, and contain no cadmium, lithium, mercury or chrome VI ( 1.000 ppm in the enamel). They are fired at very high temperature, a process which simultaneously toughens the glass. The enamels are completely integrated into the surface of the glass, giving the decoration durability and stability over time.EMALIT EVOLUTION, SERALIT EVOLUTION, OPALIT EVOLUTION and PICTUREit are

The dynamic functionality is provided by the SageGlass electrochromic coating which is located on the cavity facing surface of the exterior lite of the insulating glass unit (see Figure 1). The SageGlass coating comprises multiple layers of ceramic materials of less than a micron thick that together, and upon application of a low voltage direct current, provides the ability to reversibly tint the glass to dynamically control the admission of the sun’s heat and light. SageGlass electrochromic insulating glass units are available in a range of product configurations according to customer specifications. This EPD is specific to the Double Pane and Double Pane VARIO products. The VARIO product is offered in response to significant demand from the EU market. SageGlass VARIO IGUs include an additional U-profile that is positioned in the glass edge seal which are used to connect to retaining anchors in the façade during installation, providing a safe and secure installation. VARIO products typically use a thicker combination of additional lites than the non-VARIO version of the products. A typical IGU configuration is shown in Figure 1. Each configuration comprises (i) a support lite of float glass, the thickness of which depends on the application that is laminated to the 2.2mm device lite, (ii) a 2.2mm thick float glass lite on which the electrochromic coating is deposited (called the device lite), (iii) a third lite of float glass which is the inboard lite of the insulating glass unit (called a cover lite), the thickness and type of which depends on the application, and (iv) associated insulating glass materials which comprise metallic spacer, dessicant, sealants, laminating interlayer materials.","open_xpd_uuid":"ec3a1dk2","resilient_flooring_thickness":null,"masonry_cement_astm_c91_type":null,"cmu_glass_powder_containing":null,"steel_rebar_diameter_min":null,"density":"2500 kg /

The dynamic functionality is provided by the SageGlass electrochromic coating which is located on the cavity facing surface of the exterior lite of the insulating glass unit (see Figure 1). The SageGlass coating comprises multiple layers of ceramic materials of less than a micron thick that together, and upon application of a low voltage direct current, provides the ability to reversibly tint the glass to dynamically control the admission of the sun’s heat and light. SageGlass electrochromic insulating glass units are available in a range of product configurations according to customer specifications. This EPD is specific to the Double Pane and Double Pane VARIO products. The VARIO product is offered in response to significant demand from the EU market. SageGlass VARIO IGUs include an additional U-profile that is positioned in the glass edge seal which are used to connect to retaining anchors in the façade during installation, providing a safe and secure installation. VARIO products typically use a thicker combination of additional lites than the non-VARIO version of the products. A typical IGU configuration is shown in Figure 1. Each configuration comprises (i) a support lite of float glass, the thickness of which depends on the application that is laminated to the 2.2mm device lite, (ii) a 2.2mm thick float glass lite on which the electrochromic coating is deposited (called the device lite), (iii) a third lite of float glass which is the inboard lite of the insulating glass unit (called a cover lite), the thickness and type of which depends on the application, and (iv) associated insulating glass materials which comprise metallic spacer, dessicant, sealants, laminating interlayer materials.","open_xpd_uuid":"ec3122ee","resilient_flooring_thickness":null,"masonry_cement_astm_c91_type":null,"cmu_glass_powder_containing":null,"steel_rebar_diameter_min":null,"density":"2500 kg /

The dynamic functionality is provided by the SageGlass electrochromic coating which is located on the cavity facing surface of the exterior lite of the insulating glass unit (see Figure 1). The SageGlass coating comprises multiple layers of ceramic materials of less than a micron thick that together, and upon application of a low voltage direct current, provides the ability to reversibly tint the glass to dynamically control the admission of the sun’s heat and light. SageGlass electrochromic insulating glass units are available in a range of product configurations according to customer specifications. This EPD is specific to the Triple Pane and Triple Pane VARIO products. The VARIO product is offered in response to significant demand from the EU market. SageGlass VAIRO IGUs include an additional U-profile that is positoned in the glass edge seal which are used to connect to retaining anchors in the façade during installation, providing a safe and secure installation. VARIO products typically use a thicker combination of additional lites than the non-VARIO version of the products.","open_xpd_uuid":"ec3sw2wq","resilient_flooring_thickness":null,"masonry_cement_astm_c91_type":null,"cmu_glass_powder_containing":null,"steel_rebar_diameter_min":null,"density":"2500 kg /

It serves as a limiter for the sealant and as a storage for the desiccant, and thus contributes considerably to the permanent hermetic seal of insulating glass.

soda-lime silicate glass produced using the float procedure) - Tinted, on SGG PARSOL (body-tinted soda-lime silicate glass, produced using the float procedure)This acid etching treatment modifies the
