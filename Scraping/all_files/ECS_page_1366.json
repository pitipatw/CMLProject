Product Declaration(EPD®) describes the environmental impacts of1 m² ofmineralwool with a thermalresistance of1,52K.m2.W-1.The production site ofISOVER -Saint-Gobain do Brasilin Santo Amaro(São Paulo/ BR)uses natural and abundant raw materials (sand), using fusion and fiberizing techniques to produce glass wool. The products obtained come in the form of a \"mineralwool mat\" consisting of a softandairy structure.On  Earth,  naturally,  the  best  insulator  is  dry  immobile  air  at  10°C:  its  thermal  conductivity  factor, expressed in λ, is 0,025 W/(m.K) (watts per meter Kelvin degree). The thermal conductivity of mineral wool  is  close  to  immobile  air as  its  lambda  varies  from  0,030W/(m.K)  for  the most  efficient  to  0,040 W/(m.K) to the least. With its entangled structure, mineral wool is a porous material that traps the air, making it one of the best  insulating  materials.  The  porous  and  elastic  structure  of  the  wool  also  absorbs  noise  in  the  air, knocks and offers acoustic correction inside premises. Mineral wool containing incombustible materials does not fuel fire or propagate flames.Mineral wool insulation (glass wool) is used in buildings as well as industrial facilities. It ensures a high level  of  comfort,  lowers  energy  costs,  minimizes  carbon  dioxide  (CO2)  emissions,  prevents  heat  loss through pitched roofs, walls, floors, pipes and boilers, reduces noise pollution and protects homes and industrial facilities from the risk of fire.Mineral wool products last for the average building’s lifetime (which is often set at 50 years as a default), or as long as the insulated building component is part of the building.","open_xpd_uuid":"ec3ysb6a","resilient_flooring_thickness":null,"masonry_cement_astm_c91_type":null,"cmu_glass_powder_containing":null,"steel_rebar_diameter_min":null,"density":"40 kg / m3","access_flooring_finish_material":null,"concrete_compressive_strength_other_d":null,"wall_base_material":null,"gwp":"4.1 kgCO2e","vrt":null,"sku":null,"asphalt_min_temperature":null,"fnd":null,"cable_trays_material":null,"pdu_outlets":null,"nsf347":null,"sog":null,"recommended_application":null,"cladding_r_value":null,"ceiling_panel_nrc":null,"plc":null,"asphalt_aggregate_size_max":null,"toughened":null,"concrete_co2_entrain":null,"thickness":null,"abuse_resistant":null,"steel_bar_elongation":null,"asphalt_gtr":null,"floor_box_cover":null,"cladding_insulating_material":null,"name":"Isosound","height":null,"cmu_weight_classification":null,"manufacturing_image":null,"energy_source":null,"flat_glass_panes_thickness":null,"cmu_smoothface":null,"residential_only":null,"wall_tile":null,"is_failed":false,"large_format":null,"product_usage_image_crop_area":null,"access_flooring_adjustable_height":null,"electrochromic":null,"mosaic_tile":null,"access_flooring_rolling_load_10_pass":null,"steel_composition":null,"manufacturer":{"horizontal_logo":null,"parent":null,"postal_code":"19200","primary_activity_operator":false,"email_extensions":null,"gwp_contact":null,"latitude":53.31307,"primary_activity_digitization_qa":false,"longitude":-2.65748,"my_capabilities":null,"pilot_all_employees":false,"primary_activity_design":false,"iso9001_certified":null,"primary_activity_performance_standards_issuer":false,"iso14001_certified":null,"web_domain":"isover.com","cqd_sync_server_from":null,"primary_activity_verifier":false,"address":"Runcorn (Whitehouse Industrial Estate)","name":"Isover Saint-Gobain","owner":null,"tax_id":null,"created_on":"2019-12-23T11:46:05.534664Z","primary_activity_education":false,"user_group_collaborators":null,"primary_activity_sustainability_consulting":false,"alt_names":["Saint-Gobain Isover","Kimmco-Isover Saint Gobain","Saint-Gobain Argentina S.A. - Div.

Sound absorption is the main function of acoustic glass wool panels. The panels are also light, stable, and easy to handle and cut.\nAcoustic glass wool panels are commonly used in schools, offices, health care facilities and production premises where there is a need for noise reduction to improve the working environment. The decrease in reverberation time, sound pressure level and other acoustic parameters are related to the amount of panels used in the room as well as the placement of the panels. The acoustic panels need no maintenance and do not age. They can last as long as the building itself.

structure of glass wool gives the material excellent sound energy absorption properties. Sound absorption is the main function of acoustic glass wool panels. The panels are also light, stable, and easy to handle and cut.\nAcoustic glass wool panels are commonly used in schools, offices, health care facilities and production premises where there is a need for noise reduction to improve the working environment. The decrease in reverberation time, sound pressure level and other acoustic parameters are related to the amount of panels used in the room as well as the placement of the panels. The acoustic panels need no maintenance and do not age. They can last as long as the building itself. For aesthetic reasons, normal room surface cleaning is advised.","open_xpd_uuid":"ec39u5n8","resilient_flooring_thickness":null,"masonry_cement_astm_c91_type":null,"cmu_glass_powder_containing":null,"steel_rebar_diameter_min":null,"density":null,"access_flooring_finish_material":null,"concrete_compressive_strength_other_d":null,"wall_base_material":null,"gwp":"1.91

The glass wool is covered with a painted or woven surface layer and cut into panels of different sizes and edge designs. The edges are painted and the panels are packed in cardboard boxes. The structure of glass wool gives the material excellent sound energy absorption properties. Sound absorption is the main function of acoustic glass wool panels. The panels are also light, stable, and easy to handle and cut.  Acoustic glass wool panels are commonly used in schools, offices, health care facilities and production premises where there is a need for noise reduction to improve the working environment. The decrease in reverberation time, sound pressure level and other acoustic parameters are related to the amount of panels used in the room as well as the placement of the panels.

OF THE COMPANY DANOSA is a manufacturer with an extensive range of products aimed at covering different technical requirements for building, such as water tightness, heat and acoustic insulation, energy saving, and fire safety. In addition, evaluating the sustainable use of resources and the environmental impact of the building, form part of the criteria that drive new product development and the design of new construction systems, whether for new builds or restoration. With over 50 experience years in the sector across 5 continents, DANOSA has a range of renowned European bodies technically guarantee and certify DANOSA products and systems using the European Harmonized Standards (EC mark) and the European Technical Assessment (ETA), complying with the accepted quality standards throughout the European Union, providing peace of mind and assurance to all construction agents. DESCRIPTION OF THE PRODUCTS MAD 2, MAD 4 and MAD 4 Autoadhesive Noise pollution is an increasingly problem in modern society, deriving from the development of industrial activities, transport, construction, and leisure or recreational activities. Noise pollution has a series of effects on everyday activities, generating conditions that can lead to hearing loss, anxiety, or cardiovascular illnesses. PRODUCTS TO INSULATE AGAINST AIRBORNE NOISE Acoustic membranes M.A.D. are high density bituminous sheet ready finished in an anti-stick plastic installed between gypsum boards in walls and ceilings, or metal sheeting in building roofs. They are supplied in rolls of 1 m wide and 12 m long for MAD2 and 6 m for MAD4. These products work as anti-resonance elements that modify or reduce resonance frequencies, providing the sound dampening effect. Overall, there is 3 to 4 dBA improvement when comparing systems with and without a membrane.","open_xpd_uuid":"ec3sb3wt","resilient_flooring_thickness":null,"masonry_cement_astm_c91_type":null,"cmu_glass_powder_containing":null,"steel_rebar_diameter_min":null,"density":"1620 kg / m3","access_flooring_finish_material":null,"concrete_compressive_strength_other_d":null,"wall_base_material":null,"gwp":"2.46 kgCO2e","vrt":null,"sku":null,"asphalt_min_temperature":null,"fnd":null,"cable_trays_material":null,"pdu_outlets":null,"nsf347":null,"sog":null,"recommended_application":null,"cladding_r_value":null,"ceiling_panel_nrc":null,"plc":null,"asphalt_aggregate_size_max":null,"toughened":null,"concrete_co2_entrain":null,"thickness":"4 mm","abuse_resistant":null,"steel_bar_elongation":null,"asphalt_gtr":null,"floor_box_cover":null,"cladding_insulating_material":null,"name":"Acoustic membranes MAD 4","height":null,"cmu_weight_classification":null,"manufacturing_image":null,"energy_source":null,"flat_glass_panes_thickness":null,"cmu_smoothface":null,"residential_only":null,"wall_tile":null,"is_failed":false,"large_format":null,"product_usage_image_crop_area":null,"access_flooring_adjustable_height":null,"electrochromic":null,"mosaic_tile":null,"access_flooring_rolling_load_10_pass":null,"steel_composition":null,"manufacturer":{"horizontal_logo":null,"parent":null,"postal_code":"19290","primary_activity_operator":false,"email_extensions":null,"gwp_contact":null,"latitude":40.7267596,"primary_activity_digitization_qa":false,"longitude":-3.1767108,"my_capabilities":null,"pilot_all_employees":false,"primary_activity_design":false,"iso9001_certified":null,"primary_activity_performance_standards_issuer":false,"iso14001_certified":null,"web_domain":"danosa.com","cqd_sync_server_from":null,"primary_activity_verifier":false,"address":"19290 Fontanar, Guadalajara, Spain","name":"Derivados Asfálticos Normalizados S.A.

Environmental Product Declaration (EPD) describes the environmental impact of 1m²of acoustic ceiling with the intended use to increase sound absorption in a room to create a better indoor environment.This  Environmental Product Declaration (EPD)are valid for products produced in Ecophon production plants in Sw eden, Denmark, Poland and Finland w ith a high-quality glass w ool indifferent densities and thicknesses. The glass wool is covered w ith a painted or woven surface layer and cut into panels of different sizes and edge designs. The edges are painted and the panels are packed in cardboard boxes.The structure of glass wool gives the material excellent sound energy absorption properties. Sound absorption is the main function of acoustic glass wool panels. The panels are also light, stable, and easy to handle and cut. Acoustic glass wool panels are commonly used in schools, offices, health care facilities and production premises where there is a need for noise reduction to improve the working environment. The decrease in reverberation time, sound pressure level and other acoustic parameters are related to the amount of panels used in the room as well as the placement of the panels.The acoustic panels need no maintenance and do not age. They can last as long as the building itself. For aesthetic reasons, normal room surface cleaning is advised.","open_xpd_uuid":"ec3aeypt","resilient_flooring_thickness":null,"masonry_cement_astm_c91_type":null,"cmu_glass_powder_containing":null,"steel_rebar_diameter_min":null,"density":"7870 kg /

Environmental Product Declaration (EPD) describes the environmental impact of 1m²of acoustic ceiling with the intended use to increase sound absorption in a room to create a better indoor environment.This  Environmental Product Declaration (EPD)are valid for products produced in Ecophon production plants in Sw eden, Denmark, Poland and Finland w ith a high-quality glass w ool indifferent densities and thicknesses. The glass wool is covered w ith a painted or woven surface layer and cut into panels of different sizes and edge designs. The edges are painted and the panels are packed in cardboard boxes.The structure of glass wool gives the material excellent sound energy absorption properties. Sound absorption is the main function of acoustic glass wool panels. The panels are also light, stable, and easy to handle and cut. Acoustic glass wool panels are commonly used in schools, offices, health care facilities and production premises where there is a need for noise reduction to improve the working environment. The decrease in reverberation time, sound pressure level and other acoustic parameters are related to the amount of panels used in the room as well as the placement of the panels.The acoustic panels need no maintenance and do not age. They can last as long as the building itself. For aesthetic reasons, normal room surface cleaning is advised.","open_xpd_uuid":"ec3kfftk","resilient_flooring_thickness":null,"masonry_cement_astm_c91_type":null,"cmu_glass_powder_containing":null,"steel_rebar_diameter_min":null,"density":"7870 kg /

Environmental Product Declaration (EPD) describes the environmental impact of 1m²of acoustic ceiling with the intended use to increase sound absorption in a room to create a better indoor environment.This  Environmental Product Declaration (EPD)are valid for products produced in Ecophon production plants in Sw eden, Denmark, Poland and Finland w ith a high-quality glass w ool indifferent densities and thicknesses. The glass wool is covered w ith a painted or woven surface layer and cut into panels of different sizes and edge designs. The edges are painted and the panels are packed in cardboard boxes.The structure of glass wool gives the material excellent sound energy absorption properties. Sound absorption is the main function of acoustic glass wool panels. The panels are also light, stable, and easy to handle and cut. Acoustic glass wool panels are commonly used in schools, offices, health care facilities and production premises where there is a need for noise reduction to improve the working environment. The decrease in reverberation time, sound pressure level and other acoustic parameters are related to the amount of panels used in the room as well as the placement of the panels.The acoustic panels need no maintenance and do not age. They can last as long as the building itself. For aesthetic reasons, normal room surface cleaning is advised.","open_xpd_uuid":"ec3sefgh","resilient_flooring_thickness":null,"masonry_cement_astm_c91_type":null,"cmu_glass_powder_containing":null,"steel_rebar_diameter_min":null,"density":"7870 kg /

Environmental Product Declaration (EPD) describes  the environmental impact of 1m²of acoustic ceiling w ith the intended use  to increase  sound absorption in a room to create  a better indoor

glass  w ool indifferent  densities  and thicknesses. The  glass w ool is covered  w ith a paintedor w oven surface layer  and cut  into panels  of different  sizes and  edge  designs.  The  edges  are  painted and  the panels  are packed  in cardboard boxes.The  structure  of glass w ool gives the material excellent  sound energy  absorption properties. Sound absorption is the main function of acoustic glass w ool panels. The  panels  are also light, stable, and easy  to handle and cut. Acoustic  glass w ool panels are  commonly used in schools, offices, health care  facilities and production premises  w here there  is a need for noise reduction  to improve the w orking environment. The  decrease  in reverberation  time, sound pressure  level and other acoustic parameters  are related  to the amount of panels  used in the room as w ell as the placement  of the panels.The  acoustic  panels need  no maintenance  and do not age. They  can  last as long as the building itself. For aesthetic  reasons,  normal room surface  cleaning is advised.","open_xpd_uuid":"ec32wsy2","resilient_flooring_thickness":null,"masonry_cement_astm_c91_type":null,"cmu_glass_powder_containing":null,"steel_rebar_diameter_min":null,"density":"7870 kg /

Environmental Product Declaration (EPD) for the Hygiene product family describes the environmental impact of 1m² of acoustic ceiling with the intended use to increase sound absorption in a room to create a better indoor environment. The scope for this EPD is cradle-to-grave.The production site of Saint-Gobain Ecophon (Sweden) produces acoustic ceilings and wall absorbers based on glass wool with a plant based binder in different densities and thicknesses. The glass wool is covered with a painted or woven surface layer and cut into panels of different sizes and edge designs.Acoustic panels made of glass wool are commonly used in schools, offices, health care facilities and production premises where there is a need for noise reduction to improve the working environment. The decrease in reverberation time, sound pressure level and other acoustic parameters are related to the amount of panels used in the room as well as the placement of the panels.","open_xpd_uuid":"ec3up4xc","resilient_flooring_thickness":null,"masonry_cement_astm_c91_type":null,"cmu_glass_powder_containing":null,"steel_rebar_diameter_min":null,"density":"2320 kg /

The scope for this EPD is cradle-to-grave.The production site of Saint-Gobain Ecophon (Sweden) produces acoustic ceilings and wall absorbers based on glass wool with a plant based binder in different densities and thicknesses. The glass wool is covered with a painted or woven surface layer and cut into panels of different sizes and edge designs.Acoustic panels made of glass wool are commonly used in schools, offices, health care facilities and production premises where there is a need for noise reduction to improve the working environment. The decrease in reverberation time, sound pressure level and other acoustic parameters are related to the amount of panels used in the room as well as the placement of the panels.","open_xpd_uuid":"ec3dn5wx","resilient_flooring_thickness":null,"masonry_cement_astm_c91_type":null,"cmu_glass_powder_containing":null,"steel_rebar_diameter_min":null,"density":"2320 kg /

The scope for this EPD is cradle-to-grave.The production site of Saint-Gobain Ecophon (Sweden) produces acoustic ceilings and wall absorbers based on glass wool with a plant based binder in different densities and thicknesses. The glass wool is covered with a painted or woven surface layer and cut into panels of different sizes and edge designs.Acoustic panels made of glass wool are commonly used in schools, offices, health care facilities and production premises where there is a need for noise reduction to improve the working environment. The decrease in reverberation time, sound pressure level and other acoustic parameters are related to the amount of panels used in the room as well as the placement of the panels.","open_xpd_uuid":"ec3yb9hf","resilient_flooring_thickness":null,"masonry_cement_astm_c91_type":null,"cmu_glass_powder_containing":null,"steel_rebar_diameter_min":null,"density":"2320 kg /

Environmental Product Declaration (EPD) for the Hygiene product family describes the environmental impact of 1m² of acoustic ceiling with the intended use to increase sound absorption in a room to create a better indoor environment. The scope for this EPD is cradle-to-grave.The production site of Saint-Gobain Ecophon (Sweden) produces acoustic ceilings and wall absorbers based on glass wool with a plant based binder in different densities and thicknesses. The glass wool is covered with a painted or woven surface layer and cut into panels of different sizes and edge designs.Acoustic panels made of glass wool are commonly used in schools, offices, health care facilities and production premises where there is a need for noise reduction to improve the working environment. The decrease in reverberation time, sound pressure level and other acoustic parameters are related to the amount of panels used in the room as well as the placement of the panels.","open_xpd_uuid":"ec3fy0ru","resilient_flooring_thickness":null,"masonry_cement_astm_c91_type":null,"cmu_glass_powder_containing":null,"steel_rebar_diameter_min":null,"density":"2320 kg /

Environmental Product Declaration (EPD) for the Hygiene product family describes the environmental impact of 1m² of acoustic ceiling with the intended use to increase sound absorption in a room to create a better indoor environment. The scope for this EPD is cradle-to-grave.The production site of Saint-Gobain Ecophon (Sweden) produces acoustic ceilings and wall absorbers based on glass wool with a plant based binder in different densities and thicknesses. The glass wool is covered with a painted or woven surface layer and cut into panels of different sizes and edge designs.Acoustic panels made of glass wool are commonly used in schools, offices, health care facilities and production premises where there is a need for noise reduction to improve the working environment. The decrease in reverberation time, sound pressure level and other acoustic parameters are related to the amount of panels used in the room as well as the placement of the panels.","open_xpd_uuid":"ec3zrapn","resilient_flooring_thickness":null,"masonry_cement_astm_c91_type":null,"cmu_glass_powder_containing":null,"steel_rebar_diameter_min":null,"density":"2320 kg /

The scope for this EPD is cradle-to-grave.The production site of Saint-Gobain Ecophon (Sweden) produces acoustic ceilings and wall absorbers based on glass wool with a plant based binder in different densities and thicknesses. The glass wool is covered with a painted or woven surface layer and cut into panels of different sizes and edge designs.Acoustic panels made of glass wool are commonly used in schools, offices, health care facilities and production premises where there is a need for noise reduction to improve the working environment. The decrease in reverberation time, sound pressure level and other acoustic parameters are related to the amount of panels used in the room as well as the placement of the panels.","open_xpd_uuid":"ec32d4zy","resilient_flooring_thickness":null,"masonry_cement_astm_c91_type":null,"cmu_glass_powder_containing":null,"steel_rebar_diameter_min":null,"density":"2320 kg /

The scope for this EPD is cradle-to-grave.The production site of Saint-Gobain Ecophon (Sweden) produces acoustic ceilings and wall absorbers based on glass wool with a plant based binder in different densities and thicknesses. The glass wool is covered with a painted or woven surface layer and cut into panels of different sizes and edge designs.Acoustic panels made of glass wool are commonly used in schools, offices, health care facilities and production premises where there is a need for noise reduction to improve the working environment. The decrease in reverberation time, sound pressure level and other acoustic parameters are related to the amount of panels used in the room as well as the placement of the panels.","open_xpd_uuid":"ec3w51zb","resilient_flooring_thickness":null,"masonry_cement_astm_c91_type":null,"cmu_glass_powder_containing":null,"steel_rebar_diameter_min":null,"density":"2320 kg /

Environmental Product Declaration (EPD) for the Solo product family describes the environmental impact of 1m² of acoustic ceiling with the intended use to increase sound absorption in a room to create a better indoor environment. The scope for this EPD is cradle-to-grave.The production site of Saint-Gobain Ecophon (Sweden) produces acoustic ceilings and wall absorbers based on glass wool with a plant based binder in different densities and thicknesses. The glass wool is covered with a painted or woven surface layer and cut into panels of different sizes and edge designs.Acoustic panels made of glass wool are commonly used in schools, offices, health care facilities and production premises where there is a need for noise reduction to improve the working environment. The decrease in reverberation time, sound pressure level and other acoustic parameters are related to the amount of panels used in the room as well as the placement of the panels.","open_xpd_uuid":"ec3npezp","resilient_flooring_thickness":null,"masonry_cement_astm_c91_type":null,"cmu_glass_powder_containing":null,"steel_rebar_diameter_min":null,"density":"2320

Environmental Product Declaration (EPD) for the Solo product family describes the environmental impact of 1m² of acoustic ceiling with the intended use to increase sound absorption in a room to create a better indoor environment. The scope for this EPD is cradle-to-grave.The production site of Saint-Gobain Ecophon (Sweden) produces acoustic ceilings and wall absorbers based on glass wool with a plant based binder in different densities and thicknesses. The glass wool is covered with a painted or woven surface layer and cut into panels of different sizes and edge designs.Acoustic panels made of glass wool are commonly used in schools, offices, health care facilities and production premises where there is a need for noise reduction to improve the working environment. The decrease in reverberation time, sound pressure level and other acoustic parameters are related to the amount of panels used in the room as well as the placement of the panels.","open_xpd_uuid":"ec366are","resilient_flooring_thickness":null,"masonry_cement_astm_c91_type":null,"cmu_glass_powder_containing":null,"steel_rebar_diameter_min":null,"density":"2320

OF THE COMPANY DANOSA is a manufacturer with an extensive range of products aimed at covering different technical requirements for building, such as water tightness, heat and acoustic insulation, energy saving, and fire safety. In addition, evaluating the sustainable use of resources and the environmental impact of the building, form part of the criteria that drive new product development and the design of new construction systems, whether for new builds or restoration. With over 50 experience years in the sector across 5 continents, DANOSA has a range of renowned European bodies technically guarantee and certify DANOSA products and systems using the European Harmonized Standards (EC mark) and the European Technical Assessment (ETA), complying with the accepted quality standards throughout the European Union, providing peace of mind and assurance to all construction agents. DESCRIPTION OF THE PRODUCTS MAD 2, MAD 4 and MAD 4 Autoadhesive Noise pollution is an increasingly problem in modern society, deriving from the development of industrial activities, transport, construction, and leisure or recreational activities. Noise pollution has a series of effects on everyday activities, generating conditions that can lead to hearing loss, anxiety, or cardiovascular illnesses. PRODUCTS TO INSULATE AGAINST AIRBORNE NOISE Acoustic membranes M.A.D. are high density bituminous sheet ready finished in an anti-stick plastic installed between gypsum boards in walls and ceilings, or metal sheeting in building roofs. They are supplied in rolls of 1 m wide and 12 m long for MAD2 and 6 m for MAD4. These products work as anti-resonance elements that modify or reduce resonance frequencies, providing the sound dampening effect. Overall, there is 3 to 4 dBA improvement when comparing systems with and without a membrane.","open_xpd_uuid":"ec3b24ru","resilient_flooring_thickness":null,"masonry_cement_astm_c91_type":null,"cmu_glass_powder_containing":null,"steel_rebar_diameter_min":null,"density":"1620 kg / m3","access_flooring_finish_material":null,"concrete_compressive_strength_other_d":null,"wall_base_material":null,"gwp":"1.55 kgCO2e","vrt":null,"sku":null,"asphalt_min_temperature":null,"fnd":null,"cable_trays_material":null,"pdu_outlets":null,"nsf347":null,"sog":null,"recommended_application":null,"cladding_r_value":null,"ceiling_panel_nrc":null,"plc":null,"asphalt_aggregate_size_max":null,"toughened":null,"concrete_co2_entrain":null,"thickness":"2 mm","abuse_resistant":null,"steel_bar_elongation":null,"asphalt_gtr":null,"floor_box_cover":null,"cladding_insulating_material":null,"name":"Acoustic membranes MAD 2","height":null,"cmu_weight_classification":null,"manufacturing_image":null,"energy_source":null,"flat_glass_panes_thickness":null,"cmu_smoothface":null,"residential_only":null,"wall_tile":null,"is_failed":false,"large_format":null,"product_usage_image_crop_area":null,"access_flooring_adjustable_height":null,"electrochromic":null,"mosaic_tile":null,"access_flooring_rolling_load_10_pass":null,"steel_composition":null,"manufacturer":{"horizontal_logo":null,"parent":null,"postal_code":"19290","primary_activity_operator":false,"email_extensions":null,"gwp_contact":null,"latitude":40.7267596,"primary_activity_digitization_qa":false,"longitude":-3.1767108,"my_capabilities":null,"pilot_all_employees":false,"primary_activity_design":false,"iso9001_certified":null,"primary_activity_performance_standards_issuer":false,"iso14001_certified":null,"web_domain":"danosa.com","cqd_sync_server_from":null,"primary_activity_verifier":false,"address":"19290 Fontanar, Guadalajara, Spain","name":"Derivados Asfálticos Normalizados S.A.

OF THE COMPANY DANOSA is a manufacturer with an extensive range of products aimed at covering different technical requirements for building, such as water tightness, heat and acoustic insulation, energy saving, and fire safety. In addition, evaluating the sustainable use of resources and the environmental impact of the building, form part of the criteria that drive new product development and the design of new construction systems, whether for new builds or restoration. With over 50 experience years in the sector across 5 continents, DANOSA has a range of renowned European bodies technically guarantee and certify DANOSA products and systems using the European Harmonized Standards (EC mark) and the European Technical Assessment (ETA), complying with the accepted quality standards throughout the European Union, providing peace of mind and assurance to all construction agents. DESCRIPTION OF THE PRODUCTS MAD 2, MAD 4 and MAD 4 Autoadhesive Noise pollution is an increasingly problem in modern society, deriving from the development of industrial activities, transport, construction, and leisure or recreational activities. Noise pollution has a series of effects on everyday activities, generating conditions that can lead to hearing loss, anxiety, or cardiovascular illnesses. PRODUCTS TO INSULATE AGAINST AIRBORNE NOISE Acoustic membranes M.A.D. are high density bituminous sheet ready finished in an anti-stick plastic installed between gypsum boards in walls and ceilings, or metal sheeting in building roofs. They are supplied in rolls of 1 m wide and 12 m long for MAD2 and 6 m for MAD4. These products work as anti-resonance elements that modify or reduce resonance frequencies, providing the sound dampening effect. Overall, there is 3 to 4 dBA improvement when comparing systems with and without a membrane.","open_xpd_uuid":"ec31g4nm","resilient_flooring_thickness":null,"masonry_cement_astm_c91_type":null,"cmu_glass_powder_containing":null,"steel_rebar_diameter_min":null,"density":"1448 kg / m3","access_flooring_finish_material":null,"concrete_compressive_strength_other_d":null,"wall_base_material":null,"gwp":"2.28 kgCO2e","vrt":null,"sku":null,"asphalt_min_temperature":null,"fnd":null,"cable_trays_material":null,"pdu_outlets":null,"nsf347":null,"sog":null,"recommended_application":null,"cladding_r_value":null,"ceiling_panel_nrc":null,"plc":null,"asphalt_aggregate_size_max":null,"toughened":null,"concrete_co2_entrain":null,"thickness":"4 mm","abuse_resistant":null,"steel_bar_elongation":null,"asphalt_gtr":null,"floor_box_cover":null,"cladding_insulating_material":null,"name":"Acoustic membranes MAD 4 self adhesive","height":null,"cmu_weight_classification":null,"manufacturing_image":null,"energy_source":null,"flat_glass_panes_thickness":null,"cmu_smoothface":null,"residential_only":null,"wall_tile":null,"is_failed":false,"large_format":null,"product_usage_image_crop_area":null,"access_flooring_adjustable_height":null,"electrochromic":null,"mosaic_tile":null,"access_flooring_rolling_load_10_pass":null,"steel_composition":null,"manufacturer":{"horizontal_logo":null,"parent":null,"postal_code":"19290","primary_activity_operator":false,"email_extensions":null,"gwp_contact":null,"latitude":40.7267596,"primary_activity_digitization_qa":false,"longitude":-3.1767108,"my_capabilities":null,"pilot_all_employees":false,"primary_activity_design":false,"iso9001_certified":null,"primary_activity_performance_standards_issuer":false,"iso14001_certified":null,"web_domain":"danosa.com","cqd_sync_server_from":null,"primary_activity_verifier":false,"address":"19290 Fontanar, Guadalajara, Spain","name":"Derivados Asfálticos Normalizados S.A.

produces a family of X-technology wet felted acoustical ceiling panels at its Cloquet, MN, facility having various light reflectance, noise reduction, and attenuation specifications with various levels of post-consumer/industrial recycled content. The X-technology wet felted production line at the Cloquet facility employs a wet-felted technology in the production of acoustical ceiling panels. X-technology wet felted acoustical ceiling panels contain mostly mineral wool, starch and latex. In smaller amounts, other raw materials used in the tile forming process include flocculants, biocides and defoamer. The finishing and packaging unit processes are dominated by the use of water-based paint, which contains the following ingredients: calcium carbonate, clay, latex, titanium dioxide (TiO2) and other chemicals. Shrink-wrap and corrugated strip are used as packing materials. USG Interiors also produces a family of grid products at its Westlake, OH, Cartersville, GA, Oakville, ON, Canada and Stockton, CA facilities. This family of grid products coordinates with USG Ceilings Millennia ClimaPlus panels and includes 10 grid profiles including DX/DXL, DXW, DXT, DXF, DXFF and DXI. Each profile is available in Intermediate Duty and Heavy Duty weight. Grid production encompasses the third party production of the hot-dipped galvanized steel coils, transport of these coils to USG fabrication facilities where the steel coil is cleaned, coated (optional depending on intended purpose) and slit and optionally transported to additional production facilities where the coated steel is formed into finished grid components. These finished grid components are then packaged in cardboard boxes.","open_xpd_uuid":"ec3cx01f","resilient_flooring_thickness":null,"masonry_cement_astm_c91_type":null,"cmu_glass_powder_containing":null,"steel_rebar_diameter_min":null,"density":"2320 kg /

stone wool acoustic tiles are traditionally made from volcanic rock (typically basalt or dolomite), an increasing proportion of recycled material, and a low percentage of binder (in Rockfon acoustic tiles this is around 3-4%). The essential component of Rockfon tiles are stone wool fibres, which are monofilament synthetic mineral fibres of non-crystalline structure extracted from a silicate melt. The products described in this EPD are produced in the form of tiles in the density range from 70 up to 175 kg/m³. The products are supplied in thicknesses of 12 up to 160 mm. The acoustic tiles can have a glass fibre fleece facing and can be coated with water-based dispersion paint. Details for the environmental impacts of this type of facing can be found on the first page of the annex. The 2 additional facing of aluminium laminate may be applicable for some products. The environmental impacts of aluminium laminate are presented on the second page of the annex. Product-specific environmental impacts are compiled by applying the relevant scaling factor (listed in the table below) in the Product Specific Scaling formula. Product Specific Scaling Formula: Environmental Impact per m2 product X-with facing = Environmental Impact reference product*scaling factor+Environmental Impact facing material. Please note that the scaling factors give the precise amount of material needed to produce the other product types. Environmental Product Declaration ROCKWOOL ROCKFON GmbH - Ceiling Tiles For the placing on the market of the product in the European Union/European Free Trade Association (EU/EFTA) (with the exception of Switzerland) Regulation (EU) No. 305/2011 (CPR) applies.

The glass wool is covered with a painted or woven surface layer and cut into panels of different sizes and edge designs. The edges are painted and the panels are packed in cardboard boxes.The structure of glass wool gives the material excellent sound energy absorption properties. Soun d absorption is the main function of acoustic glass wool panels. The panels are also light, stable, and easy to handle and cut.  Acoustic glass wool panels are commonly used in schools, offices, health care facilities and production premises where there is a need for noise reduction to improve the working environment. The decrease in reverberation time, sound pressure level and other acoustic parameters are related to the amount of panels used in the room as well as the placement of the panels. The acoustic panels need no maintenance and do not age. They can last as long as the building itself. For aesthetic reasons, normal room surface cleaning is advised.","open_xpd_uuid":"ec3ukcmc","resilient_flooring_thickness":null,"masonry_cement_astm_c91_type":null,"cmu_glass_powder_containing":null,"steel_rebar_diameter_min":null,"density":null,"access_flooring_finish_material":null,"concrete_compressive_strength_other_d":null,"wall_base_material":null,"gwp":"1.87

stone wool acoustic tiles are traditionally made from volcanic rock (typically basalt or dolomite), an increasing proportion of recycled material, and a low percentage of binder (in Rockfon acoustic tiles this is around 3-4%). The essential component of Rockfon tiles are stone wool fibres, which are monofilament synthetic mineral fibres of non-crystalline structure extracted from a silicate melt. The products described in this EPD are produced in the form of tiles in the density range from 70 up to 175 kg/m³. The products are supplied in thicknesses of 12 up to 160 mm. The acoustic tiles can have a glass fibre fleece facing and can be coated with water-based dispersion paint. Details for the environmental impacts of this type of facing can be found on the first page of the annex. The 2 additional facing of aluminium laminate may be applicable for some products. The environmental impacts of aluminium laminate are presented on the second page of the annex. Product-specific environmental impacts are compiled by applying the relevant scaling factor (listed in the table below) in the Product Specific Scaling formula. Product Specific Scaling Formula: Environmental Impact per m2 product X-with facing = Environmental Impact reference product*scaling factor+Environmental Impact facing material. Please note that the scaling factors give the precise amount of material needed to produce the other product types. Environmental Product Declaration ROCKWOOL ROCKFON GmbH - Ceiling Tiles For the placing on the market of the product in the European Union/European Free Trade Association (EU/EFTA) (with the exception of Switzerland) Regulation (EU) No. 305/2011 (CPR) applies.

stone wool acoustic tiles are traditionally made from volcanic rock (typically basalt or dolomite), an increasing proportion of recycled material, and a low percentage of binder (in Rockfon acoustic tiles this is around 3-4%). The essential component of Rockfon tiles are stone wool fibres, which are monofilament synthetic mineral fibres of non-crystalline structure extracted from a silicate melt. The products described in this EPD are produced in the form of tiles in the density range from 70 up to 175 kg/m³. The products are supplied in thicknesses of 12 up to 160 mm. The acoustic tiles can have a glass fibre fleece facing and can be coated with water-based dispersion paint. Details for the environmental impacts of this type of facing can be found on the first page of the annex. The 2 additional facing of aluminium laminate may be applicable for some products. The environmental impacts of aluminium laminate are presented on the second page of the annex. Product-specific environmental impacts are compiled by applying the relevant scaling factor (listed in the table below) in the Product Specific Scaling formula. Product Specific Scaling Formula: Environmental Impact per m2 product X-with facing = Environmental Impact reference product*scaling factor+Environmental Impact facing material. Please note that the scaling factors give the precise amount of material needed to produce the other product types. Environmental Product Declaration ROCKWOOL ROCKFON GmbH - Ceiling Tiles For the placing on the market of the product in the European Union/European Free Trade Association (EU/EFTA) (with the exception of Switzerland) Regulation (EU) No. 305/2011 (CPR) applies.

stone wool acoustic tiles are traditionally made from volcanic rock (typically basalt or dolomite), an increasing proportion of recycled material, and a low percentage of binder (in Rockfon acoustic tiles this is around 3-4%). The essential component of Rockfon tiles are stone wool fibres, which are monofilament synthetic mineral fibres of non-crystalline structure extracted from a silicate melt. The products described in this EPD are produced in the form of tiles in the density range from 70 up to 175 kg/m³. The products are supplied in thicknesses of 12 up to 160 mm. The acoustic tiles can have a glass fibre fleece facing and can be coated with water-based dispersion paint. Details for the environmental impacts of this type of facing can be found on the first page of the annex. The 2 additional facing of aluminium laminate may be applicable for some products. The environmental impacts of aluminium laminate are presented on the second page of the annex. Product-specific environmental impacts are compiled by applying the relevant scaling factor (listed in the table below) in the Product Specific Scaling formula. Product Specific Scaling Formula: Environmental Impact per m2 product X-with facing = Environmental Impact reference product*scaling factor+Environmental Impact facing material. Please note that the scaling factors give the precise amount of material needed to produce the other product types. Environmental Product Declaration ROCKWOOL ROCKFON GmbH - Ceiling Tiles For the placing on the market of the product in the European Union/European Free Trade Association (EU/EFTA) (with the exception of Switzerland) Regulation (EU) No. 305/2011 (CPR) applies.

stone wool acoustic tiles are traditionally made from volcanic rock (typically basalt or dolomite), an increasing proportion of recycled material, and a low percentage of binder (in Rockfon acoustic tiles this is around 3-4%). The essential component of Rockfon tiles are stone wool fibres, which are monofilament synthetic mineral fibres of non-crystalline structure extracted from a silicate melt. The products described in this EPD are produced in the form of tiles in the density range from 70 up to 175 kg/m³. The products are supplied in thicknesses of 12 up to 160 mm. The acoustic tiles can have a glass fibre fleece facing and can be coated with water-based dispersion paint. Details for the environmental impacts of this type of facing can be found on the first page of the annex. The 2 additional facing of aluminium laminate may be applicable for some products. The environmental impacts of aluminium laminate are presented on the second page of the annex. Product-specific environmental impacts are compiled by applying the relevant scaling factor (listed in the table below) in the Product Specific Scaling formula. Product Specific Scaling Formula: Environmental Impact per m2 product X-with facing = Environmental Impact reference product*scaling factor+Environmental Impact facing material. Please note that the scaling factors give the precise amount of material needed to produce the other product types. Environmental Product Declaration ROCKWOOL ROCKFON GmbH - Ceiling Tiles For the placing on the market of the product in the European Union/European Free Trade Association (EU/EFTA) (with the exception of Switzerland) Regulation (EU) No. 305/2011 (CPR) applies.

stone wool acoustic tiles are traditionally made from volcanic rock (typically basalt or dolomite), an increasing proportion of recycled material, and a low percentage of binder (in Rockfon acoustic tiles this is around 3-4%). The essential component of Rockfon tiles are stone wool fibres, which are monofilament synthetic mineral fibres of non-crystalline structure extracted from a silicate melt. The products described in this EPD are produced in the form of tiles in the density range from 70 up to 175 kg/m³. The products are supplied in thicknesses of 12 up to 160 mm. The acoustic tiles can have a glass fibre fleece facing and can be coated with water-based dispersion paint. Details for the environmental impacts of this type of facing can be found on the first page of the annex. The 2 additional facing of aluminium laminate may be applicable for some products. The environmental impacts of aluminium laminate are presented on the second page of the annex. Product-specific environmental impacts are compiled by applying the relevant scaling factor (listed in the table below) in the Product Specific Scaling formula. Product Specific Scaling Formula: Environmental Impact per m2 product X-with facing = Environmental Impact reference product*scaling factor+Environmental Impact facing material. Please note that the scaling factors give the precise amount of material needed to produce the other product types. Environmental Product Declaration ROCKWOOL ROCKFON GmbH - Ceiling Tiles For the placing on the market of the product in the European Union/European Free Trade Association (EU/EFTA) (with the exception of Switzerland) Regulation (EU) No. 305/2011 (CPR) applies.
