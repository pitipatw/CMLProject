S.p.A. has been manufacturing insulation panels for construction services and interior design in its innovative production plant in Onara di Tombolo (PD - Italy); CELENIT is one of the flagship player in providing thermal and acoustic solutions and for the indoor comfort to Italian and international markets, thanks to the various solutions offered, in cooperation with Universities and to several laboratory test and certifications, performed according to the international standards.The CELENIT panels are made of spruce wood coming from sustainable management forests (PEFCTM and FSCÂ®) and mineral binders, mainly Portland cement and marble dust. The wood wool is subjected to a mineralization treatment, which stops the biologic deterioration -while maintaining the same mechanical properties- makes the fibers inert and increases the fire resistance. The wood wool is coated with Portland cement, and bound together under pressure to form a stable, resistant, compact and durable structure. The products are compliant to the EN 13168 standard \"Thermal insulation products for buildings. Factory made wood wool (WW) products\" and to the EN 13964 \"Suspended ceilings. Requirements and test methods\".The main applications of the wood wool panels are related to building insulations and acoustic coverings. In the first case, panels made of wood wool with a standard texture and grey Portland cement (CELENIT N) are used for the thermal-acoustic insulation of roof, walls, floors and permanent formwork. The standard, thin and extra-thin panels made of wood wool and white Portland cement (CELENIT NB, CELENIT AB, CELENIT ABE) or grey Portland cement (CELENIT A and CELENIT AE) are used for acoustic coverings such as ceilings, double walls, baffles and suspended islands or acoustic design elements.","open_xpd_uuid":"ec34824f","resilient_flooring_thickness":null,"masonry_cement_astm_c91_type":null,"cmu_glass_powder_containing":null,"steel_rebar_diameter_min":null,"density":"13 kg /

S.p.A. has been manufacturing insulation panels for construction services and interior design in its innovative production plant in Onara di Tombolo (PD - Italy); CELENIT is one of the flagship player in providing thermal and acoustic solutions and for the indoor comfort to Italian and international markets, thanks to the various solutions offered, in cooperation with Universities and to several laboratory test and certifications, performed according to the international standards.The CELENIT panels are made of spruce wood coming from sustainable management forests (PEFCTM and FSCÂ®) and mineral binders, mainly Portland cement and marble dust. The wood wool is subjected to a mineralization treatment, which stops the biologic deterioration -while maintaining the same mechanical properties- makes the fibers inert and increases the fire resistance. The wood wool is coated with Portland cement, and bound together under pressure to form a stable, resistant, compact and durable structure. The products are compliant to the EN 13168 standard \"Thermal insulation products for buildings. Factory made wood wool (WW) products\" and to the EN 13964 \"Suspended ceilings. Requirements and test methods\".The main applications of the wood wool panels are related to building insulations and acoustic coverings. In the first case, panels made of wood wool with a standard texture and grey Portland cement (CELENIT N) are used for the thermal-acoustic insulation of roof, walls, floors and permanent formwork. The standard, thin and extra-thin panels made of wood wool and white Portland cement (CELENIT NB, CELENIT AB, CELENIT ABE) or grey Portland cement (CELENIT A and CELENIT AE) are used for acoustic coverings such as ceilings, double walls, baffles and suspended islands or acoustic design elements.","open_xpd_uuid":"ec3twxta","resilient_flooring_thickness":null,"masonry_cement_astm_c91_type":null,"cmu_glass_powder_containing":null,"steel_rebar_diameter_min":null,"density":"13 kg /

S.p.A. has been manufacturing insulation panels for construction services and interior design in its innovative production plant in Onara di Tombolo (PD - Italy); CELENIT is one of the flagship player in providing thermal and acoustic solutions and for the indoor comfort to Italian and international markets, thanks to the various solutions offered, in cooperation with Universities and to several laboratory test and certifications, performed according to the international standards.The CELENIT panels are made of spruce wood coming from sustainable management forests (PEFCTM and FSCÂ®) and mineral binders, mainly Portland cement and marble dust. The wood wool is subjected to a mineralization treatment, which stops the biologic deterioration -while maintaining the same mechanical properties- makes the fibers inert and increases the fire resistance. The wood wool is coated with Portland cement, and bound together under pressure to form a stable, resistant, compact and durable structure. The products are compliant to the EN 13168 standard \"Thermal insulation products for buildings. Factory made wood wool (WW) products\" and to the EN 13964 \"Suspended ceilings. Requirements and test methods\".The main applications of the wood wool panels are related to building insulations and acoustic coverings. In the first case, panels made of wood wool with a standard texture and grey Portland cement (CELENIT N) are used for the thermal-acoustic insulation of roof, walls, floors and permanent formwork. The standard, thin and extra-thin panels made of wood wool and white Portland cement (CELENIT NB, CELENIT AB, CELENIT ABE) or grey Portland cement (CELENIT A and CELENIT AE) are used for acoustic coverings such as ceilings, double walls, baffles and suspended islands or acoustic design elements.","open_xpd_uuid":"ec3n2y3q","resilient_flooring_thickness":null,"masonry_cement_astm_c91_type":null,"cmu_glass_powder_containing":null,"steel_rebar_diameter_min":null,"density":"13 kg /

S.p.A. has been manufacturing insulation panels for construction services and interior design in its innovative production plant in Onara di Tombolo (PD - Italy); CELENIT is one of the flagship player in providing thermal and acoustic solutions and for the indoor comfort to Italian and international markets, thanks to the various solutions offered, in cooperation with Universities and to several laboratory test and certifications, performed according to the international standards.The CELENIT panels are made of spruce wood coming from sustainable management forests (PEFCTM and FSCÂ®) and mineral binders, mainly Portland cement and marble dust. The wood wool is subjected to a mineralization treatment, which stops the biologic deterioration -while maintaining the same mechanical properties- makes the fibers inert and increases the fire resistance. The wood wool is coated with Portland cement, and bound together under pressure to form a stable, resistant, compact and durable structure. The products are compliant to the EN 13168 standard \"Thermal insulation products for buildings. Factory made wood wool (WW) products\" and to the EN 13964 \"Suspended ceilings. Requirements and test methods\".The main applications of the wood wool panels are related to building insulations and acoustic coverings. In the first case, panels made of wood wool with a standard texture and grey Portland cement (CELENIT N) are used for the thermal-acoustic insulation of roof, walls, floors and permanent formwork. The standard, thin and extra-thin panels made of wood wool and white Portland cement (CELENIT NB, CELENIT AB, CELENIT ABE) or grey Portland cement (CELENIT A and CELENIT AE) are used for acoustic coverings such as ceilings, double walls, baffles and suspended islands or acoustic design elements.","open_xpd_uuid":"ec3t2mks","resilient_flooring_thickness":null,"masonry_cement_astm_c91_type":null,"cmu_glass_powder_containing":null,"steel_rebar_diameter_min":null,"density":"13 kg /

The wood wool is subjected to a mineralization treatment, which stops the biologic deterioration -while maintaining the same mechanical properties- makes the fibers inert and increases the fire resistance. The wood wool is coated with Portland cement, and bound together under pressure to form a stable, resistant, compact and durable structure. The products are compliant to the EN 13168 standard \"Thermal insulation products for buildings. Factory made wood wool (WW) products\" and to the EN 13964 \"Suspended ceilings. Requirements and test methods\".The main applications of the wood wool panels are related to building insulations and acoustic coverings. In the first case, panels made of wood wool with a standard texture and grey Portland cement (CELENIT N) are used for the thermal-acoustic insulation of roof, walls, floors and permanent formwork. The standard, thin and extra-thin panels made of wood wool and white Portland cement (CELENIT NB, CELENIT AB, CELENIT ABE) or grey Portland cement (CELENIT A and CELENIT AE) are used for acoustic

The wood wool is coated with Portland cement, and bound together under pressure to form a stable, resistant, compact and durable structure. The products are compliant to the EN 13168 standard \"Thermal insulation products for buildings. Factory made wood wool (WW) products\" and to the EN 13964 \"Suspended ceilings. Requirements and test methods\".The main applications of the wood wool panels are related to building insulations and acoustic coverings. In the first case, panels made of wood wool with a standard texture and grey Portland cement (CELENIT N) are used for the thermal-acoustic insulation of roof, walls, floors and permanent formwork. The standard, thin and extra-thin panels made of wood wool and white Portland cement (CELENIT NB, CELENIT AB, CELENIT ABE) or grey Portland cement (CELENIT A and CELENIT AE) are used for acoustic

S.p.A. has been manufacturing insulation panels for construction services and interior design in its innovative production plant in Onara di Tombolo (PD - Italy); CELENIT is one of the flagship player in providing thermal and acoustic solutions and for the indoor comfort to Italian and international markets, thanks to the various solutions offered, in cooperation with Universities and to several laboratory test and certifications, performed according to the international standards.The CELENIT panels are made of spruce wood coming from sustainable management forests (PEFCTM and FSCÂ®) and mineral binders, mainly Portland cement and marble dust. The wood wool is subjected to a mineralization treatment, which stops the biologic deterioration -while maintaining the same mechanical properties- makes the fibers inert and increases the fire resistance. The wood wool is coated with Portland cement, and bound together under pressure to form a stable, resistant, compact and durable structure. The products are compliant to the EN 13168 standard \"Thermal insulation products for buildings. Factory made wood wool (WW) products\" and to the EN 13964 \"Suspended ceilings. Requirements and test methods\".The main applications of the wood wool panels are related to building insulations and acoustic coverings. In the first case, panels made of wood wool with a standard texture and grey Portland cement (CELENIT N) are used for the thermal-acoustic insulation of roof, walls, floors and permanent formwork. The standard, thin and extra-thin panels made of wood wool and white Portland cement (CELENIT NB, CELENIT AB, CELENIT ABE) or grey Portland cement (CELENIT A and CELENIT AE) are used for acoustic coverings such as ceilings, double walls, baffles and suspended islands or acoustic design elements.","open_xpd_uuid":"ec3yu5p4","resilient_flooring_thickness":null,"masonry_cement_astm_c91_type":null,"cmu_glass_powder_containing":null,"steel_rebar_diameter_min":null,"density":"13 kg /

S.p.A. has been manufacturing insulation panels for construction services and interior design in its innovative production plant in Onara di Tombolo (PD - Italy); CELENIT is one of the flagship player in providing thermal and acoustic solutions and for the indoor comfort to Italian and international markets, thanks to the various solutions offered, in cooperation with Universities and to several laboratory test and certifications, performed according to the international standards.The CELENIT panels are made of spruce wood coming from sustainable management forests (PEFCTM and FSCÂ®) and mineral binders, mainly Portland cement and marble dust. The wood wool is subjected to a mineralization treatment, which stops the biologic deterioration -while maintaining the same mechanical properties- makes the fibers inert and increases the fire resistance. The wood wool is coated with Portland cement, and bound together under pressure to form a stable, resistant, compact and durable structure. The products are compliant to the EN 13168 standard \"Thermal insulation products for buildings. Factory made wood wool (WW) products\" and to the EN 13964 \"Suspended ceilings. Requirements and test methods\".The main applications of the wood wool panels are related to building insulations and acoustic coverings. In the first case, panels made of wood wool with a standard texture and grey Portland cement (CELENIT N) are used for the thermal-acoustic insulation of roof, walls, floors and permanent formwork. The standard, thin and extra-thin panels made of wood wool and white Portland cement (CELENIT NB, CELENIT AB, CELENIT ABE) or grey Portland cement (CELENIT A and CELENIT AE) are used for acoustic coverings such as ceilings, double walls, baffles and suspended islands or acoustic design elements.","open_xpd_uuid":"ec3h1zer","resilient_flooring_thickness":null,"masonry_cement_astm_c91_type":null,"cmu_glass_powder_containing":null,"steel_rebar_diameter_min":null,"density":"13 kg /

S.p.A. has been manufacturing insulation panels for construction services and interior design in its innovative production plant in Onara di Tombolo (PD - Italy); CELENIT is one of the flagship player in providing thermal and acoustic solutions and for the indoor comfort to Italian and international markets, thanks to the various solutions offered, in cooperation with Universities and to several laboratory test and certifications, performed according to the international standards.The CELENIT panels are made of spruce wood coming from sustainable management forests (PEFCTM and FSCÂ®) and mineral binders, mainly Portland cement and marble dust. The wood wool is subjected to a mineralization treatment, which stops the biologic deterioration -while maintaining the same mechanical properties- makes the fibers inert and increases the fire resistance. The wood wool is coated with Portland cement, and bound together under pressure to form a stable, resistant, compact and durable structure. The products are compliant to the EN 13168 standard \"Thermal insulation products for buildings. Factory made wood wool (WW) products\" and to the EN 13964 \"Suspended ceilings. Requirements and test methods\".The main applications of the wood wool panels are related to building insulations and acoustic coverings. In the first case, panels made of wood wool with a standard texture and grey Portland cement (CELENIT N) are used for the thermal-acoustic insulation of roof, walls, floors and permanent formwork. The standard, thin and extra-thin panels made of wood wool and white Portland cement (CELENIT NB, CELENIT AB, CELENIT ABE) or grey Portland cement (CELENIT A and CELENIT AE) are used for acoustic coverings such as ceilings, double walls, baffles and suspended islands or acoustic design elements.","open_xpd_uuid":"ec3gg7fq","resilient_flooring_thickness":null,"masonry_cement_astm_c91_type":null,"cmu_glass_powder_containing":null,"steel_rebar_diameter_min":null,"density":"13 kg /

S.p.A. has been manufacturing insulation panels for construction services and interior design in its innovative production plant in Onara di Tombolo (PD - Italy); CELENIT is one of the flagship player in providing thermal and acoustic solutions and for the indoor comfort to Italian and international markets, thanks to the various solutions offered, in cooperation with Universities and to several laboratory test and certifications, performed according to the international standards.The CELENIT panels are made of spruce wood coming from sustainable management forests (PEFCTM and FSCÂ®) and mineral binders, mainly Portland cement and marble dust. The wood wool is subjected to a mineralization treatment, which stops the biologic deterioration -while maintaining the same mechanical properties- makes the fibers inert and increases the fire resistance. The wood wool is coated with Portland cement, and bound together under pressure to form a stable, resistant, compact and durable structure. The products are compliant to the EN 13168 standard \"Thermal insulation products for buildings. Factory made wood wool (WW) products\" and to the EN 13964 \"Suspended ceilings. Requirements and test methods\".The main applications of the wood wool panels are related to building insulations and acoustic coverings. In the first case, panels made of wood wool with a standard texture and grey Portland cement (CELENIT N) are used for the thermal-acoustic insulation of roof, walls, floors and permanent formwork. The standard, thin and extra-thin panels made of wood wool and white Portland cement (CELENIT NB, CELENIT AB, CELENIT ABE) or grey Portland cement (CELENIT A and CELENIT AE) are used for acoustic coverings such as ceilings, double walls, baffles and suspended islands or acoustic design elements.","open_xpd_uuid":"ec3cb95k","resilient_flooring_thickness":null,"masonry_cement_astm_c91_type":null,"cmu_glass_powder_containing":null,"steel_rebar_diameter_min":null,"density":"13 kg /

S.p.A. has been manufacturing insulation panels for construction services and interior design in its innovative production plant in Onara di Tombolo (PD - Italy); CELENIT is one of the flagship player in providing thermal and acoustic solutions and for the indoor comfort to Italian and international markets, thanks to the various solutions offered, in cooperation with Universities and to several laboratory test and certifications, performed according to the international standards.The CELENIT panels are made of spruce wood coming from sustainable management forests (PEFCTM and FSCÂ®) and mineral binders, mainly Portland cement and marble dust. The wood wool is subjected to a mineralization treatment, which stops the biologic deterioration -while maintaining the same mechanical properties- makes the fibers inert and increases the fire resistance. The wood wool is coated with Portland cement, and bound together under pressure to form a stable, resistant, compact and durable structure. The products are compliant to the EN 13168 standard \"Thermal insulation products for buildings. Factory made wood wool (WW) products\" and to the EN 13964 \"Suspended ceilings. Requirements and test methods\".The main applications of the wood wool panels are related to building insulations and acoustic coverings. In the first case, panels made of wood wool with a standard texture and grey Portland cement (CELENIT N) are used for the thermal-acoustic insulation of roof, walls, floors and permanent formwork. The standard, thin and extra-thin panels made of wood wool and white Portland cement (CELENIT NB, CELENIT AB, CELENIT ABE) or grey Portland cement (CELENIT A and CELENIT AE) are used for acoustic coverings such as ceilings, double walls, baffles and suspended islands or acoustic design elements.","open_xpd_uuid":"ec3py2pg","resilient_flooring_thickness":null,"masonry_cement_astm_c91_type":null,"cmu_glass_powder_containing":null,"steel_rebar_diameter_min":null,"density":"13 kg /

S.p.A. has been manufacturing insulation panels for construction services and interior design in its innovative production plant in Onara di Tombolo (PD - Italy); CELENIT is one of the flagship player in providing thermal and acoustic solutions and for the indoor comfort to Italian and international markets, thanks to the various solutions offered, in cooperation with Universities and to several laboratory test and certifications, performed according to the international standards.The CELENIT panels are made of spruce wood coming from sustainable management forests (PEFCTM and FSCÂ®) and mineral binders, mainly Portland cement and marble dust. The wood wool is subjected to a mineralization treatment, which stops the biologic deterioration -while maintaining the same mechanical properties- makes the fibers inert and increases the fire resistance. The wood wool is coated with Portland cement, and bound together under pressure to form a stable, resistant, compact and durable structure. The products are compliant to the EN 13168 standard \"Thermal insulation products for buildings. Factory made wood wool (WW) products\" and to the EN 13964 \"Suspended ceilings. Requirements and test methods\".The main applications of the wood wool panels are related to building insulations and acoustic coverings. In the first case, panels made of wood wool with a standard texture and grey Portland cement (CELENIT N) are used for the thermal-acoustic insulation of roof, walls, floors and permanent formwork. The standard, thin and extra-thin panels made of wood wool and white Portland cement (CELENIT NB, CELENIT AB, CELENIT ABE) or grey Portland cement (CELENIT A and CELENIT AE) are used for acoustic coverings such as ceilings, double walls, baffles and suspended islands or acoustic design elements.","open_xpd_uuid":"ec337ujx","resilient_flooring_thickness":null,"masonry_cement_astm_c91_type":null,"cmu_glass_powder_containing":null,"steel_rebar_diameter_min":null,"density":"13 kg /

S.p.A. has been manufacturing insulation panels for construction services and interior design in its innovative production plant in Onara di Tombolo (PD - Italy); CELENIT is one of the flagship player in providing thermal and acoustic solutions and for the indoor comfort to Italian and international markets, thanks to the various solutions offered, in cooperation with Universities and to several laboratory test and certifications, performed according to the international standards.The CELENIT panels are made of spruce wood coming from sustainable management forests (PEFCTM and FSCÂ®) and mineral binders, mainly Portland cement and marble dust. The wood wool is subjected to a mineralization treatment, which stops the biologic deterioration -while maintaining the same mechanical properties- makes the fibers inert and increases the fire resistance. The wood wool is coated with Portland cement, and bound together under pressure to form a stable, resistant, compact and durable structure. The products are compliant to the EN 13168 standard \"Thermal insulation products for buildings. Factory made wood wool (WW) products\" and to the EN 13964 \"Suspended ceilings. Requirements and test methods\".The main applications of the wood wool panels are related to building insulations and acoustic coverings. In the first case, panels made of wood wool with a standard texture and grey Portland cement (CELENIT N) are used for the thermal-acoustic insulation of roof, walls, floors and permanent formwork. The standard, thin and extra-thin panels made of wood wool and white Portland cement (CELENIT NB, CELENIT AB, CELENIT ABE) or grey Portland cement (CELENIT A and CELENIT AE) are used for acoustic coverings such as ceilings, double walls, baffles and suspended islands or acoustic design elements.","open_xpd_uuid":"ec375y31","resilient_flooring_thickness":null,"masonry_cement_astm_c91_type":null,"cmu_glass_powder_containing":null,"steel_rebar_diameter_min":null,"density":"13 kg /

S.p.A. has been manufacturing insulation panels for construction services and interior design in its innovative production plant in Onara di Tombolo (PD - Italy); CELENIT is one of the flagship player in providing thermal and acoustic solutions and for the indoor comfort to Italian and international markets, thanks to the various solutions offered, in cooperation with Universities and to several laboratory test and certifications, performed according to the international standards.The CELENIT panels are made of spruce wood coming from sustainable management forests (PEFCTM and FSCÂ®) and mineral binders, mainly Portland cement and marble dust. The wood wool is subjected to a mineralization treatment, which stops the biologic deterioration -while maintaining the same mechanical properties- makes the fibers inert and increases the fire resistance. The wood wool is coated with Portland cement, and bound together under pressure to form a stable, resistant, compact and durable structure. The products are compliant to the EN 13168 standard \"Thermal insulation products for buildings. Factory made wood wool (WW) products\" and to the EN 13964 \"Suspended ceilings. Requirements and test methods\".The main applications of the wood wool panels are related to building insulations and acoustic coverings. In the first case, panels made of wood wool with a standard texture and grey Portland cement (CELENIT N) are used for the thermal-acoustic insulation of roof, walls, floors and permanent formwork. The standard, thin and extra-thin panels made of wood wool and white Portland cement (CELENIT NB, CELENIT AB, CELENIT ABE) or grey Portland cement (CELENIT A and CELENIT AE) are used for acoustic coverings such as ceilings, double walls, baffles and suspended islands or acoustic design elements.","open_xpd_uuid":"ec3y967r","resilient_flooring_thickness":null,"masonry_cement_astm_c91_type":null,"cmu_glass_powder_containing":null,"steel_rebar_diameter_min":null,"density":"13 kg /

S.p.A. has been manufacturing insulation panels for construction services and interior design in its innovative production plant in Onara di Tombolo (PD - Italy); CELENIT is one of the flagship player in providing thermal and acoustic solutions and for the indoor comfort to Italian and international markets, thanks to the various solutions offered, in cooperation with Universities and to several laboratory test and certifications, performed according to the international standards.The CELENIT panels are made of spruce wood coming from sustainable management forests (PEFCTM and FSCÂ®) and mineral binders, mainly Portland cement and marble dust. The wood wool is subjected to a mineralization treatment, which stops the biologic deterioration -while maintaining the same mechanical properties- makes the fibers inert and increases the fire resistance. The wood wool is coated with Portland cement, and bound together under pressure to form a stable, resistant, compact and durable structure. The products are compliant to the EN 13168 standard \"Thermal insulation products for buildings. Factory made wood wool (WW) products\" and to the EN 13964 \"Suspended ceilings. Requirements and test methods\".The main applications of the wood wool panels are related to building insulations and acoustic coverings. In the first case, panels made of wood wool with a standard texture and grey Portland cement (CELENIT N) are used for the thermal-acoustic insulation of roof, walls, floors and permanent formwork. The standard, thin and extra-thin panels made of wood wool and white Portland cement (CELENIT NB, CELENIT AB, CELENIT ABE) or grey Portland cement (CELENIT A and CELENIT AE) are used for acoustic coverings such as ceilings, double walls, baffles and suspended islands or acoustic design elements.","open_xpd_uuid":"ec3fapfp","resilient_flooring_thickness":null,"masonry_cement_astm_c91_type":null,"cmu_glass_powder_containing":null,"steel_rebar_diameter_min":null,"density":"13 kg /

S.p.A. has been manufacturing insulation panels for construction services and interior design in its innovative production plant in Onara di Tombolo (PD - Italy); CELENIT is one of the flagship player in providing thermal and acoustic solutions and for the indoor comfort to Italian and international markets, thanks to the various solutions offered, in cooperation with Universities and to several laboratory test and certifications, performed according to the international standards.The CELENIT panels are made of spruce wood coming from sustainable management forests (PEFCTM and FSCÂ®) and mineral binders, mainly Portland cement and marble dust. The wood wool is subjected to a mineralization treatment, which stops the biologic deterioration -while maintaining the same mechanical properties- makes the fibers inert and increases the fire resistance. The wood wool is coated with Portland cement, and bound together under pressure to form a stable, resistant, compact and durable structure. The products are compliant to the EN 13168 standard \"Thermal insulation products for buildings. Factory made wood wool (WW) products\" and to the EN 13964 \"Suspended ceilings. Requirements and test methods\".The main applications of the wood wool panels are related to building insulations and acoustic coverings. In the first case, panels made of wood wool with a standard texture and grey Portland cement (CELENIT N) are used for the thermal-acoustic insulation of roof, walls, floors and permanent formwork. The standard, thin and extra-thin panels made of wood wool and white Portland cement (CELENIT NB, CELENIT AB, CELENIT ABE) or grey Portland cement (CELENIT A and CELENIT AE) are used for acoustic coverings such as ceilings, double walls, baffles and suspended islands or acoustic design elements.","open_xpd_uuid":"ec3p034p","resilient_flooring_thickness":null,"masonry_cement_astm_c91_type":null,"cmu_glass_powder_containing":null,"steel_rebar_diameter_min":null,"density":"13 kg /

S.p.A. has been manufacturing insulation panels for construction services and interior design in its innovative production plant in Onara di Tombolo (PD - Italy); CELENIT is one of the flagship player in providing thermal and acoustic solutions and for the indoor comfort to Italian and international markets, thanks to the various solutions offered, in cooperation with Universities and to several laboratory test and certifications, performed according to the international standards.The CELENIT panels are made of spruce wood coming from sustainable management forests (PEFCTM and FSCÂ®) and mineral binders, mainly Portland cement and marble dust. The wood wool is subjected to a mineralization treatment, which stops the biologic deterioration -while maintaining the same mechanical properties- makes the fibers inert and increases the fire resistance. The wood wool is coated with Portland cement, and bound together under pressure to form a stable, resistant, compact and durable structure. The products are compliant to the EN 13168 standard \"Thermal insulation products for buildings. Factory made wood wool (WW) products\" and to the EN 13964 \"Suspended ceilings. Requirements and test methods\".The main applications of the wood wool panels are related to building insulations and acoustic coverings. In the first case, panels made of wood wool with a standard texture and grey Portland cement (CELENIT N) are used for the thermal-acoustic insulation of roof, walls, floors and permanent formwork. The standard, thin and extra-thin panels made of wood wool and white Portland cement (CELENIT NB, CELENIT AB, CELENIT ABE) or grey Portland cement (CELENIT A and CELENIT AE) are used for acoustic coverings such as ceilings, double walls, baffles and suspended islands or acoustic design elements.","open_xpd_uuid":"ec30q869","resilient_flooring_thickness":null,"masonry_cement_astm_c91_type":null,"cmu_glass_powder_containing":null,"steel_rebar_diameter_min":null,"density":"13 kg /

S.p.A. has been manufacturing insulation panels for construction services and interior design in its innovative production plant in Onara di Tombolo (PD - Italy); CELENIT is one of the flagship player in providing thermal and acoustic solutions and for the indoor comfort to Italian and international markets, thanks to the various solutions offered, in cooperation with Universities and to several laboratory test and certifications, performed according to the international standards.The CELENIT panels are made of spruce wood coming from sustainable management forests (PEFCTM and FSCÂ®) and mineral binders, mainly Portland cement and marble dust. The wood wool is subjected to a mineralization treatment, which stops the biologic deterioration -while maintaining the same mechanical properties- makes the fibers inert and increases the fire resistance. The wood wool is coated with Portland cement, and bound together under pressure to form a stable, resistant, compact and durable structure. The products are compliant to the EN 13168 standard \"Thermal insulation products for buildings. Factory made wood wool (WW) products\" and to the EN 13964 \"Suspended ceilings. Requirements and test methods\".The main applications of the wood wool panels are related to building insulations and acoustic coverings. In the first case, panels made of wood wool with a standard texture and grey Portland cement (CELENIT N) are used for the thermal-acoustic insulation of roof, walls, floors and permanent formwork. The standard, thin and extra-thin panels made of wood wool and white Portland cement (CELENIT NB, CELENIT AB, CELENIT ABE) or grey Portland cement (CELENIT A and CELENIT AE) are used for acoustic coverings such as ceilings, double walls, baffles and suspended islands or acoustic design elements.","open_xpd_uuid":"ec3zrgge","resilient_flooring_thickness":null,"masonry_cement_astm_c91_type":null,"cmu_glass_powder_containing":null,"steel_rebar_diameter_min":null,"density":"13 kg /

S.p.A. has been manufacturing insulation panels for construction services and interior design in its innovative production plant in Onara di Tombolo (PD - Italy); CELENIT is one of the flagship player in providing thermal and acoustic solutions and for the indoor comfort to Italian and international markets, thanks to the various solutions offered, in cooperation with Universities and to several laboratory test and certifications, performed according to the international standards.The CELENIT panels are made of spruce wood coming from sustainable management forests (PEFCTM and FSCÂ®) and mineral binders, mainly Portland cement and marble dust. The wood wool is subjected to a mineralization treatment, which stops the biologic deterioration -while maintaining the same mechanical properties- makes the fibers inert and increases the fire resistance. The wood wool is coated with Portland cement, and bound together under pressure to form a stable, resistant, compact and durable structure. The products are compliant to the EN 13168 standard \"Thermal insulation products for buildings. Factory made wood wool (WW) products\" and to the EN 13964 \"Suspended ceilings. Requirements and test methods\".The main applications of the wood wool panels are related to building insulations and acoustic coverings. In the first case, panels made of wood wool with a standard texture and grey Portland cement (CELENIT N) are used for the thermal-acoustic insulation of roof, walls, floors and permanent formwork. The standard, thin and extra-thin panels made of wood wool and white Portland cement (CELENIT NB, CELENIT AB, CELENIT ABE) or grey Portland cement (CELENIT A and CELENIT AE) are used for acoustic coverings such as ceilings, double walls, baffles and suspended islands or acoustic design elements.","open_xpd_uuid":"ec3321gk","resilient_flooring_thickness":null,"masonry_cement_astm_c91_type":null,"cmu_glass_powder_containing":null,"steel_rebar_diameter_min":null,"density":"13 kg /

S.p.A. has been manufacturing insulation panels for construction services and interior design in its innovative production plant in Onara di Tombolo (PD - Italy); CELENIT is one of the flagship player in providing thermal and acoustic solutions and for the indoor comfort to Italian and international markets, thanks to the various solutions offered, in cooperation with Universities and to several laboratory test and certifications, performed according to the international standards.The CELENIT panels are made of spruce wood coming from sustainable management forests (PEFCTM and FSCÂ®) and mineral binders, mainly Portland cement and marble dust. The wood wool is subjected to a mineralization treatment, which stops the biologic deterioration -while maintaining the same mechanical properties- makes the fibers inert and increases the fire resistance. The wood wool is coated with Portland cement, and bound together under pressure to form a stable, resistant, compact and durable structure. The products are compliant to the EN 13168 standard \"Thermal insulation products for buildings. Factory made wood wool (WW) products\" and to the EN 13964 \"Suspended ceilings. Requirements and test methods\".The main applications of the wood wool panels are related to building insulations and acoustic coverings. In the first case, panels made of wood wool with a standard texture and grey Portland cement (CELENIT N) are used for the thermal-acoustic insulation of roof, walls, floors and permanent formwork. The standard, thin and extra-thin panels made of wood wool and white Portland cement (CELENIT NB, CELENIT AB, CELENIT ABE) or grey Portland cement (CELENIT A and CELENIT AE) are used for acoustic coverings such as ceilings, double walls, baffles and suspended islands or acoustic design elements.","open_xpd_uuid":"ec32jz58","resilient_flooring_thickness":null,"masonry_cement_astm_c91_type":null,"cmu_glass_powder_containing":null,"steel_rebar_diameter_min":null,"density":"13 kg /

S.p.A. has been manufacturing insulation panels for construction services and interior design in its innovative production plant in Onara di Tombolo (PD - Italy); CELENIT is one of the flagship player in providing thermal and acoustic solutions and for the indoor comfort to Italian and international markets, thanks to the various solutions offered, in cooperation with Universities and to several laboratory test and certifications, performed according to the international standards.The CELENIT panels are made of spruce wood coming from sustainable management forests (PEFCTM and FSCÂ®) and mineral binders, mainly Portland cement and marble dust. The wood wool is subjected to a mineralization treatment, which stops the biologic deterioration -while maintaining the same mechanical properties- makes the fibers inert and increases the fire resistance. The wood wool is coated with Portland cement, and bound together under pressure to form a stable, resistant, compact and durable structure. The products are compliant to the EN 13168 standard \"Thermal insulation products for buildings. Factory made wood wool (WW) products\" and to the EN 13964 \"Suspended ceilings. Requirements and test methods\".The main applications of the wood wool panels are related to building insulations and acoustic coverings. In the first case, panels made of wood wool with a standard texture and grey Portland cement (CELENIT N) are used for the thermal-acoustic insulation of roof, walls, floors and permanent formwork. The standard, thin and extra-thin panels made of wood wool and white Portland cement (CELENIT NB, CELENIT AB, CELENIT ABE) or grey Portland cement (CELENIT A and CELENIT AE) are used for acoustic coverings such as ceilings, double walls, baffles and suspended islands or acoustic design elements.","open_xpd_uuid":"ec338pm6","resilient_flooring_thickness":null,"masonry_cement_astm_c91_type":null,"cmu_glass_powder_containing":null,"steel_rebar_diameter_min":null,"density":"13 kg /

S.p.A. has been manufacturing insulation panels for construction services and interior design in its innovative production plant in Onara di Tombolo (PD - Italy); CELENIT is one of the flagship player in providing thermal and acoustic solutions and for the indoor comfort to Italian and international markets, thanks to the various solutions offered, in cooperation with Universities and to several laboratory test and certifications, performed according to the international standards.The CELENIT panels are made of spruce wood coming from sustainable management forests (PEFCTM and FSCÂ®) and mineral binders, mainly Portland cement and marble dust. The wood wool is subjected to a mineralization treatment, which stops the biologic deterioration -while maintaining the same mechanical properties- makes the fibers inert and increases the fire resistance. The wood wool is coated with Portland cement, and bound together under pressure to form a stable, resistant, compact and durable structure. The products are compliant to the EN 13168 standard \"Thermal insulation products for buildings. Factory made wood wool (WW) products\" and to the EN 13964 \"Suspended ceilings. Requirements and test methods\".The main applications of the wood wool panels are related to building insulations and acoustic coverings. In the first case, panels made of wood wool with a standard texture and grey Portland cement (CELENIT N) are used for the thermal-acoustic insulation of roof, walls, floors and permanent formwork. The standard, thin and extra-thin panels made of wood wool and white Portland cement (CELENIT NB, CELENIT AB, CELENIT ABE) or grey Portland cement (CELENIT A and CELENIT AE) are used for acoustic coverings such as ceilings, double walls, baffles and suspended islands or acoustic design elements.","open_xpd_uuid":"ec3p7w64","resilient_flooring_thickness":null,"masonry_cement_astm_c91_type":null,"cmu_glass_powder_containing":null,"steel_rebar_diameter_min":null,"density":"13 kg /

S.p.A. has been manufacturing insulation panels for construction services and interior design in its innovative production plant in Onara di Tombolo (PD - Italy); CELENIT is one of the flagship player in providing thermal and acoustic solutions and for the indoor comfort to Italian and international markets, thanks to the various solutions offered, in cooperation with Universities and to several laboratory test and certifications, performed according to the international standards.The CELENIT panels are made of spruce wood coming from sustainable management forests (PEFCTM and FSCÂ®) and mineral binders, mainly Portland cement and marble dust. The wood wool is subjected to a mineralization treatment, which stops the biologic deterioration -while maintaining the same mechanical properties- makes the fibers inert and increases the fire resistance. The wood wool is coated with Portland cement, and bound together under pressure to form a stable, resistant, compact and durable structure. The products are compliant to the EN 13168 standard \"Thermal insulation products for buildings. Factory made wood wool (WW) products\" and to the EN 13964 \"Suspended ceilings. Requirements and test methods\".The main applications of the wood wool panels are related to building insulations and acoustic coverings. In the first case, panels made of wood wool with a standard texture and grey Portland cement (CELENIT N) are used for the thermal-acoustic insulation of roof, walls, floors and permanent formwork. The standard, thin and extra-thin panels made of wood wool and white Portland cement (CELENIT NB, CELENIT AB, CELENIT ABE) or grey Portland cement (CELENIT A and CELENIT AE) are used for acoustic coverings such as ceilings, double walls, baffles and suspended islands or acoustic design elements.","open_xpd_uuid":"ec3f91f2","resilient_flooring_thickness":null,"masonry_cement_astm_c91_type":null,"cmu_glass_powder_containing":null,"steel_rebar_diameter_min":null,"density":"13 kg /

S.p.A. has been manufacturing insulation panels for construction services and interior design in its innovative production plant in Onara di Tombolo (PD - Italy); CELENIT is one of the flagship player in providing thermal and acoustic solutions and for the indoor comfort to Italian and international markets, thanks to the various solutions offered, in cooperation with Universities and to several laboratory test and certifications, performed according to the international standards.The CELENIT panels are made of spruce wood coming from sustainable management forests (PEFCTM and FSCÂ®) and mineral binders, mainly Portland cement and marble dust. The wood wool is subjected to a mineralization treatment, which stops the biologic deterioration -while maintaining the same mechanical properties- makes the fibers inert and increases the fire resistance. The wood wool is coated with Portland cement, and bound together under pressure to form a stable, resistant, compact and durable structure. The products are compliant to the EN 13168 standard \"Thermal insulation products for buildings. Factory made wood wool (WW) products\" and to the EN 13964 \"Suspended ceilings. Requirements and test methods\".The main applications of the wood wool panels are related to building insulations and acoustic coverings. In the first case, panels made of wood wool with a standard texture and grey Portland cement (CELENIT N) are used for the thermal-acoustic insulation of roof, walls, floors and permanent formwork. The standard, thin and extra-thin panels made of wood wool and white Portland cement (CELENIT NB, CELENIT AB, CELENIT ABE) or grey Portland cement (CELENIT A and CELENIT AE) are used for acoustic coverings such as ceilings, double walls, baffles and suspended islands or acoustic design elements.","open_xpd_uuid":"ec3k88c2","resilient_flooring_thickness":null,"masonry_cement_astm_c91_type":null,"cmu_glass_powder_containing":null,"steel_rebar_diameter_min":null,"density":"13 kg /

definition Insulation boards made of NeoporÂ® Plus BMB are expandable polystyrenes (EPS) with polymer flame retardants (Polymer FR). âBMBâ stands for âBiomass Balanceâ products. The Biomass Balance method uses renewable raw materials such as bio-naphtha or biogas in the manufacture of chemical base products by the production network of BASF along with fossil raw materials. The organic content is then allocated to certain BASF sales products such as NeoporÂ® Plus BMB granulate in accordance with a certified method /TÃV SÃ¼d Standard CMS 71/. BMB products display the same quality as non-BMB products as the product formulation is identical to that of its fossil equivalent. the form of a certificate of a standard recognised by the Renewable Energy Directive. NeoporÂ® Plus BMB granulate is manufactured from biogas extracted from kitchen waste. The biogas used is certified in accordance with the /REDcert/ system. Directive (EU) No. 305/2011 (CPR) applies for placing the product on the market in the EU/EFTA (with the exception of Switzerland). The product requires a Declaration of Performance taking consideration of the /EN 13163:2012+A1:2015/, Thermal insulation materials for buildings - Factory-made expanded polystyrene (EPS) products - Specifications, and CE marking. Use is governed by the respective national regulations. The BMB approach applied by BASF supports the use of renewable raw materials which leads to savings in fossil resources and lower greenhouse gas emissions.

At the start of the process a mix of chemicals is added directly to the bottom layer of facing and then expands to meet the top layer of facing. As it dries, the foam becomes tacky and adheres itself to the facing, top and bottom. Once it has reached the necessary thickness the foam is cured under pressure. It is then moved onto a secondary oven to cure and harden, becoming bright pink in colour. The insulation boards are then cut into the necessary sizes, packaged and sent to the loading bay for collection. Process flow diagram Construction Installation The product will be installed in external wall applications. Use Information The product will be left alone after installation, there are no known associated environmental impacts. End of Life The insulation will be removed for disposal when the building reaches the end of its life. The foam can be used for waste to energy. However, for this study it is assumed that the majority
