ETICS technology conforms to a set of globally acknowledged standards which also take into account the procedures and installation techniques related with application. These standards were historically established in Europe but have since been taken to all parts of the globe. The system contains components including the basic insulation material (EPS - Expanded Polystyrene Foam or Mineral Wool), layers of adhesive, mechanical fasteners, a reinforced layer with fibre glass mesh, reinforcements and accessories, primers and plasters. Addition of the system to the external wall of a structure can create a major impact towards reducing the amount of electricity needed for cooling/heating the interior of the building. The topcoat finishing layer of ETICS successfully refreshes the external facade of a structure through a variety of available finishes which also enhance the aesthetic qualities of the building. Indeed, suitably designed and detailed ETICS retains a fresh, clean appearance for a substantial period of time.","open_xpd_uuid":"ec3k1722","resilient_flooring_thickness":null,"masonry_cement_astm_c91_type":null,"cmu_glass_powder_containing":null,"steel_rebar_diameter_min":null,"density":null,"access_flooring_finish_material":null,"concrete_compressive_strength_other_d":null,"wall_base_material":null,"gwp":"13.2

ETICS technology conforms to a set of globally acknowledged standards which also take into account the procedures and installation techniques related with application. These standards were historically established in Europe but have since been taken to all parts of the globe. The system contains components including the basic insulation material (EPS - Expanded Polystyrene Foam or Mineral Wool), layers of adhesive, mechanical fasteners, a reinforced layer with fibre glass mesh, reinforcements and accessories, primers and plasters. Addition of the system to the external wall of a structure can create a major impact towards reducing the amount of electricity needed for cooling/heating the interior of the building. The topcoat finishing layer of ETICS successfully refreshes the external facade of a structure through a variety of available finishes which also enhance the aesthetic qualities of the building. Indeed, suitably designed and detailed ETICS retains a fresh, clean appearance for a substantial period of time.","open_xpd_uuid":"ec3385rj","resilient_flooring_thickness":null,"masonry_cement_astm_c91_type":null,"cmu_glass_powder_containing":null,"steel_rebar_diameter_min":null,"density":null,"access_flooring_finish_material":null,"concrete_compressive_strength_other_d":null,"wall_base_material":null,"gwp":"12.4

SILENT WALL is an outside, light weight wall element which can be used as a non-load bearing exterior wall element for Multi-storey buildings. The wall concept is developed by Saint-Gobain with a combination of innovative products from ISOVER, Weber and Gyproc. This combination of products creates a wall element which brings a solution with high level of acoustic and thermal insulation comfort inside the dwellings where the solution is to be installed. It features a high performance from a sustainability point of view and it has a low weight per m2. The solution can be used in areas with an equivalent outside noise level of 65dB close to achieve sound class B according to Swedish Building regulations (BBR). The wall element is fire safe (EI60) and is moisture safe as it can dry out both outwards and inwards. It ensures a low energy use in the building due to its high insulating property (U=0,16 W/m2/K). The Saint-Gobain Silent Wall is economical as it has a relatively low wall thickness for the given U-value hence enabling more square meters living space. It can be supplied with higher and lower U-values hence lower and higher wall thickness and the actual EPD reflects an “average” scenario.","open_xpd_uuid":"ec3begwu","resilient_flooring_thickness":null,"masonry_cement_astm_c91_type":null,"cmu_glass_powder_containing":null,"steel_rebar_diameter_min":null,"density":null,"access_flooring_finish_material":null,"concrete_compressive_strength_other_d":null,"wall_base_material":null,"gwp":"48.3

products covered in this report are the QuadCore  4” panels within the KS Series manufactured at\nKingspan’s DeLand, Florida, United States facility. Insulated Metal Panels (IMPs) in their simplest form are rigid foam sandwiched between two sheets of coated metal. The panels are molded in a variety of styles and sizes depending on application. Steel panel facings create a vapor, air and moisture barrier and provide long-term thermal stability. The metal skins offer long-term durability and come in a multitude of colors and finishes. Kingspan’s QuadCore IMPs utilize a hybrid insulation core with a closed microcell structure.

products covered in this report are the QuadCore 3” panels within the KS Series manufactured at\nKingspan’s DeLand, Florida, United States facility. Insulated Metal Panels (IMPs) in their simplest form are rigid foam sandwiched between two sheets of coated metal. The panels are molded in a variety of styles and sizes depending on application. Steel panel facings create a vapor, air and moisture barrier and provide long-term thermal stability. The metal skins offer long-term durability and come in a multitude of colors and finishes. Kingspan’s QuadCore IMPs utilize a hybrid insulation core with a closed microcell structure.

products covered in this report are the QuadCore 3” panels within the KS Series manufactured at Kingspan’s Langley, British Columbia, Canada facility. Insulated Metal Panels (IMPs) in their simplest form are rigid foam sandwiched between two sheets of coated metal. The panels are molded in a variety of styles and sizes depending on application. Steel panel facings create a vapor, air and moisture barrier and provide long-term thermal stability. The metal skins offer long-term durability and come in a multitude of colors and finishes. Kingspan’s QuadCore IMPs utilize a hybrid insulation core with a closed microcell structure.

products covered in this report are the QuadCore 4” panels within the Designwall 4000, KS Series, and\nOptimo series manufactured at Kingspan’s Modesto, California, USA facility. Insulated Metal Panels (IMPs) in their simplest form are rigid foam sandwiched between two sheets of coated metal. The panels are molded in a variety of styles and sizes depending on application. Steel panel facings create a vapor, air and moisture barrier and provide long-term thermal stability. The metal skins offer long-term durability and come in a multitude of colors and finishes. Kingspan’s QuadCore IMPs utilize a hybrid insulation core with a closed microcell structure.

They consist of two external metal sheets which enclose an insulating core. This EPD takes into consideration sandwich panels with insulating core in polyurethane (PUR) or polyisocyanurate (PIR) foam. The metal sheets considered are made of steel; they are subjected to profiling and the metal layer is protected from corrosion by galvanizing and pre-painting. The declared insulating panels can be used for roofing and walls of industrial, commercial, civil, animal husbandry, food and health sector buildings. They are light, versatile and easy to install, ensuring thermal and acoustic insulation, solidity, air and water tightness and safety in case of fire. Piva Group offers an extremely wide production range of sandwich panels, which includes different thicknesses, colors and surface finishes to create customized solutions with an innovative

They consist of two external metal sheets which enclose an insulating core. This EPD takes into consideration sandwich panels with insulating core in polyurethane (PUR) or polyisocyanurate (PIR) foam. The metal sheets considered are made of steel; they are subjected to profiling and the metal layer is protected from corrosion by galvanizing and pre-painting. The declared insulating panels can be used for roofing and walls of industrial, commercial, civil, animal husbandry, food and health sector buildings. They are light, versatile and easy to install, ensuring thermal and acoustic insulation, solidity, air and water tightness and safety in case of fire. Piva Group offers an extremely wide production range of sandwich panels, which includes different thicknesses, colors and surface finishes to create customized solutions with an innovative

thermal protection of both existing and new buildings can be effectively achieved by using thermal insulation externally as a building envelope much like the action of a thermos flask. ETICS technology conforms to a set of globally acknowledged standards which also take into account the procedures and installation techniques related with application. These standards were historically established in Europe but have since been taken to all parts of the globe. The system contains components including the basic insulation material (EPS - Expanded Polystyrene Foam or Mineral Wool), layers of adhesive, mechanical fasteners, a reinforced layer with fibre glass mesh, reinforcements and accessories, primers and plasters. Addition of the system to the external wall of a structure can create a major impact towards reducing the amount of electricity needed for cooling/heating the interior of the building. The topcoat finishing layer of ETICS successfully refreshes the external facade of a structure through a variety of available finishes which also enhance the aesthetic qualities of the building. Indeed, suitably designed and detailed ETICS retains a fresh, clean appearance for a substantial period of time.","open_xpd_uuid":"ec38yh2q","resilient_flooring_thickness":null,"masonry_cement_astm_c91_type":null,"cmu_glass_powder_containing":null,"steel_rebar_diameter_min":null,"density":null,"access_flooring_finish_material":null,"concrete_compressive_strength_other_d":null,"wall_base_material":null,"gwp":"10.5

wall panel systems (KS1000AWP/EVO/RW) provide a firesafe, fibre-free and high thermal performance building solution offering a simplified method of construction and high speed of build, when compared with traditional multi-component building systems.These panel systems are suitable for many wall applications and configurations (either horizontally or vertically installed), are available in a wide range of coating systems, profiles and colours, and are fully Factory Mutual (FM) Approved as an insurance company preferred system. The panels consist of an exterior steel face and an internal steel liner sheet surrounding a high performing insulant core. Typical examples of applications include external building facades for commercial and retail sectors, hospitals, internal feature and dividing walls, stadiums and educational and government buildings. The products have wide ranging performance properties that enable them to be used on almost any type of building. Coating systems can be varied to suit specific applications and variable levels of environmental exposure.The declared unit is 1m2 of panel with a specific thermal resistance

wall panel systems (KS1000AWP/EVO/RW) provide a firesafe, fibre-free and high thermal performance building solution offering a simplified method of construction and high speed of build, when compared with traditional multi-component building systems.These panel systems are suitable for many wall applications and configurations (either horizontally or vertically installed), are available in a wide range of coating systems, profiles and colours, and are fully Factory Mutual (FM) Approved as an insurance company preferred system. The panels consist of an exterior steel face and an internal steel liner sheet surrounding a high performing insulant core. Typical examples of applications include external building facades for commercial and retail sectors, hospitals, internal feature and dividing walls, stadiums and educational and government buildings. The products have wide ranging performance properties that enable them to be used on almost any type of building. Coating systems can be varied to suit specific applications and variable levels of environmental exposure.The declared unit is 1m2 of panel with a specific thermal resistance

wall panel systems (KS1000AWP/EVO/RW) provide a firesafe, fibre-free and high thermal performance building solution offering a simplified method of construction and high speed of build, when compared with traditional multi-component building systems.These panel systems are suitable for many wall applications and configurations (either horizontally or vertically installed), are available in a wide range of coating systems, profiles and colours, and are fully Factory Mutual (FM) Approved as an insurance company preferred system. The panels consist of an exterior steel face and an internal steel liner sheet surrounding a high performing insulant core. Typical examples of applications include external building facades for commercial and retail sectors, hospitals, internal feature and dividing walls, stadiums and educational and government buildings. The products have wide ranging performance properties that enable them to be used on almost any type of building. Coating systems can be varied to suit specific applications and variable levels of environmental exposure.The declared unit is 1m2 of panel with a specific thermal resistance

wall panel systems (KS1000AWP/EVO/RW) provide a firesafe, fibre-free and high thermal performance building solution offering a simplified method of construction and high speed of build, when compared with traditional multi-component building systems.These panel systems are suitable for many wall applications and configurations (either horizontally or vertically installed), are available in a wide range of coating systems, profiles and colours, and are fully Factory Mutual (FM) Approved as an insurance company preferred system. The panels consist of an exterior steel face and an internal steel liner sheet surrounding a high performing insulant core. Typical examples of applications include external building facades for commercial and retail sectors, hospitals, internal feature and dividing walls, stadiums and educational and government buildings. The products have wide ranging performance properties that enable them to be used on almost any type of building. Coating systems can be varied to suit specific applications and variable levels of environmental exposure.The declared unit is 1m2 of panel with a specific thermal resistance

sandwich panels are elements for the building's envelope. They consist of two external metal sheet supports, which enclose an insulating core. This EPD takes into consideration sandwich panels with an insulating core of mineral wool. The metal sheets are composed of steel, subjected to profiling; the metal layer is protected against corrosion by galvanizing and pre-painting. The declared insulation panels can be used for roof and wall of industrial, commercial, civil buildings, animal husbandry and cold logistics. They are light, versatile and easy to assemble and guarantee thermal and acoustic insulation, solidity, air tightness and safety in the event of a fire. Isopan offers an extremely wide range of metal panels, which includes different thicknesses, colors and surface finishes to create customized solutions with an innovative design. The declared unit is 1m2 of panel with a specific thermal resistance

sandwich panels are elements for the building's envelope. They consist of two external metal sheet supports, which enclose an insulating core. This EPD takes into consideration sandwich panels with an insulating core of mineral wool. The metal sheets are composed of steel, subjected to profiling; the metal layer is protected against corrosion by galvanizing and pre-painting. The declared insulation panels can be used for roof and wall of industrial, commercial, civil buildings, animal husbandry and cold logistics. They are light, versatile and easy to assemble and guarantee thermal and acoustic insulation, solidity, air tightness and safety in the event of a fire. Isopan offers an extremely wide range of metal panels, which includes different thicknesses, colors and surface finishes to create customized solutions with an innovative design. The declared unit is 1m2 of panel with a specific thermal resistance

veneer lumber, LVL by Stora Enso, is an advanced wood product developed for the demands of today’s building and construction industry. Being one of the strongest wood-based construction materials relative to its weight, LVL is powering a new wave of agile, renewable construction. LVL by Stora Enso is made from 3 mm thick, rotary-peeled veneers that are bonded together under heat and pressure. It is suitable for a wide range of structural applications, such as studs, post-and-beam frames, wall, floor and roof panels. Being one of the strongest wood-based construction materials relative to its weight, LVL provides an ideal solution when strength, dimensional stability and high load-bearing capacity are essential. Not forgetting the consistent quality and excellent workability. LVL is a renewable alternative to traditional construction materials that can have large environmental footprints. As trees grow – and when they are used as timber in buildings – they efficiently store carbon.","open_xpd_uuid":"ec3g3d40","resilient_flooring_thickness":null,"masonry_cement_astm_c91_type":null,"cmu_glass_powder_containing":null,"steel_rebar_diameter_min":null,"density":"562.5 kg /

LVL laminated veneer lumber products are used in all types of construction projects, from new buildings to renovation and repair. Kerto LVL is incredibly strong and dimensionally stable. Kerto LVL derives its high strength from its homogeneous bonded structure. Kerto LVL is made as continuous billet which is cut to length and sawn into LVL beams, planks or panels according to the customer’s requirements. The wood raw material for Kerto LVL originates from sustainable northern forests. Kerto LVL structures in construction act as long-term carbon storage. The service life of Kerto LVL is considered to be as long as the lifetime of the building, providing the Kerto LVL product is installed according to instructions. Kerto LVL is the best choice for fast, light and sustainable construction. The core competence of Metsä Wood is industrial-scale manufacturing. Offsite partners of Metsä Wood develop their elements and modules using versatile Kerto LVL products and element

cement, UN CPC 3744, is defined in ASTM C125 as granulated blast-furnace slag that has been ground to cement fineness, with or without additions, and that is a hydraulic cement [2]. Slag cement is a supplementary cementitious material (SCM). Iron blast furnace slag (BFS) is a waste material of pig iron production and as such is categorized as a “recovered material” [2]. To transform iron BFS, so it can be used as a SCM in concrete and\nmortars, it is first rapidly quenched with water to form granules known as Granulated Blast Furnace Slag (GBFS). It then undergoes dewatering, crushing of oversized material only (if applicable), and storage at the granulating facilities. GBFS is then shipped to the grinding facilities where it undergoes dewatering/drying (if applicable), iron removal from slag granules (if applicable), crushing (if applicable), grinding, and packaging (if applicable). The slag cement is then stored onsite.","open_xpd_uuid":"ec33ycpr","resilient_flooring_thickness":null,"masonry_cement_astm_c91_type":null,"cmu_glass_powder_containing":null,"steel_rebar_diameter_min":null,"density":"1440 kg /

is a high quality ground granulated blastfurnace slag (GGBS). Blastfurnace slag originates as a limestone based by-product of the smelting of iron ore. Granulated slag is ground to a fine dry off-white powder, and has a chemistry similar to that of ordinary Portland cement. Ecocem is normally used in combination with an alkaline material (such as Portland cement) in making cementitous-based products. The Irish Concrete Standard permits concrete to comprise up to 70% Ecocem, the remainder being Portland cement; the UK concrete standard permits concrete to comprise up to 80%.","open_xpd_uuid":"ec38p4c0","resilient_flooring_thickness":null,"masonry_cement_astm_c91_type":null,"cmu_glass_powder_containing":null,"steel_rebar_diameter_min":null,"density":"1440

Ecocem is normally used in combination with an alkaline material (such as Portland cement) in making cementitous-based products.
