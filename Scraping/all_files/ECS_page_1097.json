Life cycle stages not included in this EPD: • A4: Transportation to the construction site • A5: Construction (reinforcement, forming, placing, curing, etc.) • B1-7: Building use and maintenance • C1-4: End of life This information can be used to model the environmental impacts of the concrete component of products that use concrete, including (but not limited to): cast-in-place concrete,

Life cycle stages not included in this EPD: • A4: Transportation to the construction site • A5: Construction (reinforcement, forming, placing, curing, etc.) • B1-7: Building use and maintenance • C1-4: End of life This information can be used to model the environmental impacts of the concrete component of products that use concrete, including (but not limited to): cast-in-place concrete,

Concrete mixes are identified by a combination of an 8-digit alphanumeric mix code and one of the seven service areas listed above. Mixes with identical mix codes share the same performance specifications but may have different mix designs (specifying the quantity of materials per cubic yard of concrete) based on the service area where they are batched. This EPD reports the impacts for the product \"concrete\" (ASTM C94, UNSPSC code 30111500, CSI Specification Section 03 30 00) and covers the life cycle phases A1-A3 (`cradle-to-gate'). Life cycle stages not included in this EPD: • A4: Transportation to the construction site • A5: Construction (reinforcement, forming, placing, curing, etc.) • B1-7: Building use and maintenance • C1-4: End of life This information can be used to model the environmental impacts of the concrete component of products that use concrete, including (but not limited to): cast-in-place concrete, precast concrete, concrete masonry units, mass concrete, and concrete pavements, provided the life cycle impacts of all additional materials and processes are accounted for and the information is integrated into a comprehensive

Concrete mixes are identified by a combination of an 8-digit alphanumeric mix code and one of the seven service areas listed above. Mixes with identical mix codes share the same performance specifications but may have different mix designs (specifying the quantity of materials per cubic yard of concrete) based on the service area where they are batched.

Life cycle stages not included in this EPD: • A4: Transportation to the construction site • A5: Construction (reinforcement, forming, placing, curing, etc.) • B1-7: Building use and maintenance • C1-4: End of life This information can be used to model the environmental impacts of the concrete component of products that use concrete, including (but not limited to): cast-in-place concrete,

Life cycle stages not included in this EPD: • A4: Transportation to the construction site • A5: Construction (reinforcement, forming, placing, curing, etc.) • B1-7: Building use and maintenance • C1-4: End of life This information can be used to model the environmental impacts of the concrete component of products that use concrete, including (but not limited to): cast-in-place concrete,

Concrete mixes are identified by a combination of an 8-digit alphanumeric mix code and one of the seven service areas listed above.

Life cycle stages not included in this EPD: • A4: Transportation to the construction site • A5: Construction (reinforcement, forming, placing, curing, etc.) • B1-7: Building use and maintenance • C1-4: End of life This information can be used to model the environmental impacts of the concrete component of products that use concrete, including (but not limited to): cast-in-place concrete,

Concrete mixes are identified by a combination of an 8-digit alphanumeric mix code and one of the seven service areas listed above. Mixes with identical mix codes share the same performance specifications but may have different mix designs (specifying the quantity of materials per cubic yard of concrete) based on the service area where they are batched. This EPD reports the impacts for the product \"concrete\" (ASTM C94, UNSPSC code 30111500, CSI Specification Section 03 30 00) and covers the life cycle phases A1-A3 (`cradle-to-gate'). Life cycle stages not included in this EPD: • A4: Transportation to the construction site • A5: Construction (reinforcement, forming, placing, curing, etc.) • B1-7: Building use and maintenance • C1-4: End of life This information can be used to model the environmental impacts of the concrete component of products that use concrete, including (but not limited to): cast-in-place concrete, precast concrete, concrete masonry units, mass concrete, and concrete pavements, provided the life cycle impacts of all additional materials and processes are accounted for and the information is integrated into a comprehensive

Concrete mixes are identified by a combination of an 8-digit alphanumeric mix code and one of the seven service areas listed above. Mixes with identical mix codes share the same performance specifications but may have different mix designs (specifying the quantity of materials per cubic yard of concrete) based on the service area where they are batched.

Life cycle stages not included in this EPD: • A4: Transportation to the construction site • A5: Construction (reinforcement, forming, placing, curing, etc.) • B1-7: Building use and maintenance • C1-4: End of life This information can be used to model the environmental impacts of the concrete component of products that use concrete, including (but not limited to): cast-in-place concrete,

Concrete mixes are identified by a combination of an 8-digit alphanumeric mix code and one of the seven service areas listed above. Mixes with identical mix codes share the same performance specifications but may have different mix designs (specifying the quantity of materials per cubic yard of concrete) based on the service area where they are batched.

Life cycle stages not included in this EPD: • A4: Transportation to the construction site • A5: Construction (reinforcement, forming, placing, curing, etc.) • B1-7: Building use and maintenance • C1-4: End of life This information can be used to model the environmental impacts of the concrete component of products that use concrete, including (but not limited to): cast-in-place concrete, precast concrete, concrete masonry units, mass concrete, and concrete pavements, provided the life cycle impacts of all additional materials and processes are accounted for and the information is

Life cycle stages not included in this EPD: • A4: Transportation to the construction site • A5: Construction (reinforcement, forming, placing, curing, etc.) • B1-7: Building use and maintenance • C1-4: End of life This information can be used to model the environmental impacts of the concrete component of products that use concrete, including (but not limited to): cast-in-place concrete,

Concrete mixes are identified by a combination of an 8-digit alphanumeric mix code and one of the seven service areas listed above. Mixes with identical mix codes share the same performance specifications but may have different mix designs (specifying the quantity of materials per cubic yard of concrete) based on the service area where they are batched. This EPD reports the impacts for the product \"concrete\" (ASTM C94, UNSPSC code 30111500, CSI Specification Section 03 30 00) and covers the life cycle phases A1-A3 (`cradle-to-gate'). Life cycle stages not included in this EPD: • A4: Transportation to the construction site • A5: Construction (reinforcement, forming, placing, curing, etc.) • B1-7: Building use and maintenance • C1-4: End of life This information can be used to model the environmental impacts of the concrete component of products that use concrete, including (but not limited to): cast-in-place concrete, precast concrete, concrete masonry units, mass concrete, and concrete pavements, provided the life cycle impacts of all additional materials and processes are accounted for and the information is

Concrete mixes are identified by a combination of an 8-digit alphanumeric mix code and one of the seven service areas listed above. Mixes with identical mix codes share the same performance specifications but may have different mix designs (specifying the quantity of materials per cubic yard of concrete) based on the service area where they are batched. This EPD reports the impacts for the product \"concrete\" (ASTM C94, UNSPSC code 30111500, CSI Specification Section 03 30 00) and covers the life cycle phases A1-A3 (`cradle-to-gate'). Life cycle stages not included in this EPD: • A4: Transportation to the construction site • A5: Construction (reinforcement, forming, placing, curing, etc.) • B1-7: Building use and maintenance • C1-4: End of life This information can be used to model the environmental impacts of the concrete component of products that use concrete, including (but not limited to): cast-in-place concrete, precast concrete, concrete masonry units, mass concrete, and concrete pavements, provided the life cycle impacts of all additional materials and processes are accounted for and the information is

Life cycle stages not included in this EPD: • A4: Transportation to the construction site • A5: Construction (reinforcement, forming, placing, curing, etc.) • B1-7: Building use and maintenance • C1-4: End of life This information can be used to model the environmental impacts of the concrete component of products that use concrete, including (but not limited to): cast-in-place concrete, precast concrete, concrete masonry units, mass concrete, and concrete pavements, provided the life cycle impacts of all additional materials and processes are accounted for and the information is

Life cycle stages not included in this EPD: • A4: Transportation to the construction site • A5: Construction (reinforcement, forming, placing, curing, etc.) • B1-7: Building use and maintenance • C1-4: End of life This information can be used to model the environmental impacts of the concrete component of products that use concrete, including (but not limited to): cast-in-place concrete,

Concrete mixes are identified by a combination of an 8-digit alphanumeric mix code and one of the seven service areas listed above. Mixes with identical mix codes share the same performance specifications but may have different mix designs (specifying the quantity of materials per cubic yard of concrete) based on the service area where they are batched. This EPD reports the impacts for the product \"concrete\" (ASTM C94, UNSPSC code 30111500, CSI Specification Section 03 30 00) and covers the life cycle phases A1-A3 (`cradle-to-gate'). Life cycle stages not included in this EPD: • A4: Transportation to the construction site • A5: Construction (reinforcement, forming, placing, curing, etc.) • B1-7: Building use and maintenance • C1-4: End of life This information can be used to model the environmental impacts of the concrete component of products that use concrete, including (but not limited to): cast-in-place concrete, precast concrete, concrete masonry units, mass concrete, and concrete pavements, provided the life cycle impacts of all additional materials and processes are accounted for and the information is

Concrete mixes are identified by a combination of an 8-digit alphanumeric mix code and one of the seven service areas listed above. Mixes with identical mix codes share the same performance specifications but may have different mix designs (specifying the quantity of materials per cubic yard of concrete) based on the service area where they are batched.

Life cycle stages not included in this EPD: • A4: Transportation to the construction site • A5: Construction (reinforcement, forming, placing, curing, etc.) • B1-7: Building use and maintenance • C1-4: End of life This information can be used to model the environmental impacts of the concrete component of products that use concrete, including (but not limited to): cast-in-place concrete,

Life cycle stages not included in this EPD: • A4: Transportation to the construction site • A5: Construction (reinforcement, forming, placing, curing, etc.) • B1-7: Building use and maintenance • C1-4: End of life This information can be used to model the environmental impacts of the concrete component of products that use concrete, including (but not limited to): cast-in-place concrete, precast concrete, concrete masonry units, mass concrete, and concrete pavements, provided the life cycle impacts of all additional materials and processes are accounted for and the information is

Concrete mixes are identified by a combination of an 8-digit alphanumeric mix code and one of the seven service areas listed above.

Life cycle stages not included in this EPD: • A4: Transportation to the construction site • A5: Construction (reinforcement, forming, placing, curing, etc.) • B1-7: Building use and maintenance • C1-4: End of life This information can be used to model the environmental impacts of the concrete component of products that use concrete, including (but not limited to): cast-in-place concrete,

Concrete mixes are identified by a combination of an 8-digit alphanumeric mix code and one of the seven service areas listed above. Mixes with identical mix codes share the same performance specifications but may have different mix designs (specifying the quantity of materials per cubic yard of concrete) based on the service area where they are batched. This EPD reports the impacts for the product \"concrete\" (ASTM C94, UNSPSC code 30111500, CSI Specification Section 03 30 00) and covers the life cycle phases A1-A3 (`cradle-to-gate'). Life cycle stages not included in this EPD: • A4: Transportation to the construction site • A5: Construction (reinforcement, forming, placing, curing, etc.) • B1-7: Building use and maintenance • C1-4: End of life This information can be used to model the environmental impacts of the concrete component of products that use concrete, including (but not limited to): cast-in-place concrete, precast concrete, concrete masonry units, mass concrete, and concrete pavements, provided the life cycle impacts of all additional materials and processes are accounted for and the information is

Concrete mixes are identified by a combination of an 8-digit alphanumeric mix code and one of the seven service areas listed above. Mixes with identical mix codes share the same performance specifications but may have different mix designs (specifying the quantity of materials per cubic yard of concrete) based on the service area where they are batched.

Life cycle stages not included in this EPD: • A4: Transportation to the construction site • A5: Construction (reinforcement, forming, placing, curing, etc.) • B1-7: Building use and maintenance • C1-4: End of life This information can be used to model the environmental impacts of the concrete component of products that use concrete, including (but not limited to): cast-in-place concrete,

Life cycle stages not included in this EPD: • A4: Transportation to the construction site • A5: Construction (reinforcement, forming, placing, curing, etc.) • B1-7: Building use and maintenance • C1-4: End of life This information can be used to model the environmental impacts of the concrete component of products that use concrete, including (but not limited to): cast-in-place concrete,

Life cycle stages not included in this EPD: • A4: Transportation to the construction site • A5: Construction (reinforcement, forming, placing, curing, etc.) • B1-7: Building use and maintenance • C1-4: End of life This information can be used to model the environmental impacts of the concrete component of products that use concrete, including (but not limited to): cast-in-place concrete,

Concrete mixes are identified by a combination of an 8-digit alphanumeric mix code and one of the seven service areas listed above. Mixes with identical mix codes share the same performance specifications but may have different mix designs (specifying the quantity of materials per cubic yard of concrete) based on the service area where they are batched. This EPD reports the impacts for the product \"concrete\" (ASTM C94, UNSPSC code 30111500, CSI Specification Section 03 30 00) and covers the life cycle phases A1-A3 (`cradle-to-gate'). Life cycle stages not included in this EPD: • A4: Transportation to the construction site • A5: Construction (reinforcement, forming, placing, curing, etc.) • B1-7: Building use and maintenance • C1-4: End of life This information can be used to model the environmental impacts of the concrete component of products that use concrete, including (but not limited to): cast-in-place concrete, precast concrete, concrete masonry units, mass concrete, and concrete pavements, provided the life cycle impacts of all additional materials and processes are accounted for and the information is integrated into a comprehensive

Concrete mixes are identified by a combination of an 8-digit alphanumeric mix code and one of the seven service areas listed above.

Life cycle stages not included in this EPD: • A4: Transportation to the construction site • A5: Construction (reinforcement, forming, placing, curing, etc.) • B1-7: Building use and maintenance • C1-4: End of life This information can be used to model the environmental impacts of the concrete component of products that use concrete, including (but not limited to): cast-in-place concrete,

Life cycle stages not included in this EPD: • A4: Transportation to the construction site • A5: Construction (reinforcement, forming, placing, curing, etc.) • B1-7: Building use and maintenance • C1-4: End of life This information can be used to model the environmental impacts of the concrete component of products that use concrete, including (but not limited to): cast-in-place concrete,

Concrete mixes are identified by a combination of an 8-digit alphanumeric mix code and one of the seven service areas listed above. Mixes with identical mix codes share the same performance specifications but may have different mix designs (specifying the quantity of materials per cubic yard of concrete) based on the service area where they are batched.

Life cycle stages not included in this EPD: • A4: Transportation to the construction site • A5: Construction (reinforcement, forming, placing, curing, etc.) • B1-7: Building use and maintenance • C1-4: End of life This information can be used to model the environmental impacts of the concrete component of products that use concrete, including (but not limited to): cast-in-place concrete,

Concrete mixes are identified by a combination of an 8-digit alphanumeric mix code and one of the seven service areas listed above. Mixes with identical mix codes share the same performance specifications but may have different mix designs (specifying the quantity of materials per cubic yard of concrete) based on the service area where they are batched. This EPD reports the impacts for the product \"concrete\" (ASTM C94, UNSPSC code 30111500, CSI Specification Section 03 30 00) and covers the life cycle phases A1-A3 (`cradle-to-gate'). Life cycle stages not included in this EPD: • A4: Transportation to the construction site • A5: Construction (reinforcement, forming, placing, curing, etc.) • B1-7: Building use and maintenance • C1-4: End of life This information can be used to model the environmental impacts of the concrete component of products that use concrete, including (but not limited to): cast-in-place concrete, precast concrete, concrete masonry units, mass concrete, and concrete pavements, provided the life cycle impacts of all additional materials and processes are accounted for and the information is

Concrete mixes are identified by a combination of an 8-digit alphanumeric mix code and one of the seven service areas listed above. Mixes with identical mix codes share the same performance specifications but may have different mix designs (specifying the quantity of materials per cubic yard of concrete) based on the service area where they are batched. This EPD reports the impacts for the product \"concrete\" (ASTM C94, UNSPSC code 30111500, CSI Specification Section 03 30 00) and covers the life cycle phases A1-A3 (`cradle-to-gate'). Life cycle stages not included in this EPD: • A4: Transportation to the construction site • A5: Construction (reinforcement, forming, placing, curing, etc.) • B1-7: Building use and maintenance • C1-4: End of life This information can be used to model the environmental impacts of the concrete component of products that use concrete, including (but not limited to): cast-in-place concrete, precast concrete, concrete masonry units, mass concrete, and concrete pavements, provided the life cycle impacts of all additional materials and processes are accounted for and the information is

Life cycle stages not included in this EPD: • A4: Transportation to the construction site • A5: Construction (reinforcement, forming, placing, curing, etc.) • B1-7: Building use and maintenance • C1-4: End of life This information can be used to model the environmental impacts of the concrete component of products that use concrete, including (but not limited to): cast-in-place concrete,

Concrete mixes are identified by a combination of an 8-digit alphanumeric mix code and one of the seven service areas listed above.

Life cycle stages not included in this EPD: • A4: Transportation to the construction site • A5: Construction (reinforcement, forming, placing, curing, etc.) • B1-7: Building use and maintenance • C1-4: End of life This information can be used to model the environmental impacts of the concrete component of products that use concrete, including (but not limited to): cast-in-place concrete,

Concrete mixes are identified by a combination of an 8-digit alphanumeric mix code and one of the seven service areas listed above. Mixes with identical mix codes share the same performance specifications but may have different mix designs (specifying the quantity of materials per cubic yard of concrete) based on the service area where they are batched. This EPD reports the impacts for the product \"concrete\" (ASTM C94, UNSPSC code 30111500, CSI Specification Section 03 30 00) and covers the life cycle phases A1-A3 (`cradle-to-gate'). Life cycle stages not included in this EPD: • A4: Transportation to the construction site • A5: Construction (reinforcement, forming, placing, curing, etc.) • B1-7: Building use and maintenance • C1-4: End of life This information can be used to model the environmental impacts of the concrete component of products that use concrete, including (but not limited to): cast-in-place concrete, precast concrete, concrete masonry units, mass concrete, and concrete pavements, provided the life cycle impacts of all additional materials and processes are accounted for and the information is

Concrete mixes are identified by a combination of an 8-digit alphanumeric mix code and one of the seven service areas listed above. Mixes with identical mix codes share the same performance specifications but may have different mix designs (specifying the quantity of materials per cubic yard of concrete) based on the service area where they are batched.

Life cycle stages not included in this EPD: • A4: Transportation to the construction site • A5: Construction (reinforcement, forming, placing, curing, etc.) • B1-7: Building use and maintenance • C1-4: End of life This information can be used to model the environmental impacts of the concrete component of products that use concrete, including (but not limited to): cast-in-place concrete,

Concrete mixes are identified by a combination of an 8-digit alphanumeric mix code and one of the seven service areas listed above. Mixes with identical mix codes share the same performance specifications but may have different mix designs (specifying the quantity of materials per cubic yard of concrete) based on the service area where they are batched.

Life cycle stages not included in this EPD: • A4: Transportation to the construction site • A5: Construction (reinforcement, forming, placing, curing, etc.) • B1-7: Building use and maintenance • C1-4: End of life This information can be used to model the environmental impacts of the concrete component of products that use concrete, including (but not limited to): cast-in-place concrete, precast concrete, concrete masonry units, mass concrete, and concrete pavements, provided the life cycle impacts of all additional materials and processes are accounted for and the information is

Concrete mixes are identified by a combination of an 8-digit alphanumeric mix code and one of the seven service areas listed above.

Life cycle stages not included in this EPD: • A4: Transportation to the construction site • A5: Construction (reinforcement, forming, placing, curing, etc.) • B1-7: Building use and maintenance • C1-4: End of life This information can be used to model the environmental impacts of the concrete component of products that use concrete, including (but not limited to): cast-in-place concrete,

Concrete mixes are identified by a combination of an 8-digit alphanumeric mix code and one of the seven service areas listed above. Mixes with identical mix codes share the same performance specifications but may have different mix designs (specifying the quantity of materials per cubic yard of concrete) based on the service area where they are batched. This EPD reports the impacts for the product \"concrete\" (ASTM C94, UNSPSC code 30111500, CSI Specification Section 03 30 00) and covers the life cycle phases A1-A3 (`cradle-to-gate'). Life cycle stages not included in this EPD: • A4: Transportation to the construction site • A5: Construction (reinforcement, forming, placing, curing, etc.) • B1-7: Building use and maintenance • C1-4: End of life This information can be used to model the environmental impacts of the concrete component of products that use concrete, including (but not limited to): cast-in-place concrete, precast concrete, concrete masonry units, mass concrete, and concrete pavements, provided the life cycle impacts of all additional materials and processes are accounted for and the information is

Life cycle stages not included in this EPD: • A4: Transportation to the construction site • A5: Construction (reinforcement, forming, placing, curing, etc.) • B1-7: Building use and maintenance •

Life cycle stages not included in this EPD: • A4: Transportation to the construction site • A5: Construction (reinforcement, forming, placing, curing, etc.) • B1-7: Building use and maintenance • C1-4: End of life This information can be used to model the environmental impacts of the concrete component of products that use concrete, including (but not limited to): cast-in-place concrete,

Concrete mixes are identified by a combination of an 8-digit alphanumeric mix code and one of the seven service areas listed above. Mixes with identical mix codes share the same performance specifications but may have different mix designs (specifying the quantity of materials per cubic yard of concrete) based on the service area where they are batched. This EPD reports the impacts for the product \"concrete\" (ASTM C94, UNSPSC code 30111500, CSI Specification Section 03 30 00) and covers the life cycle phases A1-A3 (`cradle-to-gate'). Life cycle stages not included in this EPD: • A4: Transportation to the construction site • A5: Construction (reinforcement, forming, placing, curing, etc.) • B1-7: Building use and maintenance • C1-4: End of life This information can be used to model the environmental impacts of the concrete component of products that use concrete, including (but not limited to): cast-in-place concrete, precast concrete, concrete masonry units, mass concrete, and concrete pavements, provided the life cycle impacts of all additional materials and processes are accounted for and the information is
