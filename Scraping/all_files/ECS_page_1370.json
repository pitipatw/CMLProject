Interiors produces a family of X-technology wet felted acoustical ceiling panels at its Cloquet, MN, facility having\nvarious light reflectance, noise reduction, and attenuation specifications with

X-technology wet felted acoustical ceiling panels contain mostly mineral wool,\nstarch and latex. In smaller amounts, other raw materials used in the panel forming process include flocculants, biocides\nand de-foamer. The finishing and packaging unit processes are dominated by the use of water-based paint, which\ncontains ingredients such as calcium carbonate, clay, latex, titanium dioxide (TiO2) and other chemicals. Shrink-wrap and\ncorrugated strip are used as packing materials.\nUSG Interiors, LLC also produces a family of grid products at its Westlake, OH, Cartersville, GA, Oakville, ON, Canada\nand Stockton, CA facilities. This family of grid products coordinates with USG Ceilings Mars ClimaPlus panels and\nincludes 8 grid profiles including DX/DXL, DXW, DXT, DXF, DXFF and DXI. Each profile is available in Intermediate Duty\nand Heavy Duty weight. Grid production encompasses the third-party production of the hot-dipped galvanized steel coils,\ntransport of these coils to USG fabrication facilities where the steel coil is cleaned, coated (optional depending on\nintended purpose) and slit and optionally transported to additional production facilities where the coated steel is formed\ninto finished grid components. These finished grid components are then packaged in cardboard boxes.\nProduct

Regarding to the products structure, cables are composed by micromodules (which contain the optical fibres) stranded in a cable core without central element, as well as a water blocking yarns and/or tapes. Furthermore, the optical fibre cables have a fibreglass reinforcement elements embedded in the outer sheath, and eventual aramid yarns in the cable code. The outer covering is made from black high density polyethylene UV-resistant sheath.

assessed product references are outdoor and water-blocking compact optical fibre micromodule cables, which are made from a black polyethylene sheath withfibreglass reinforcements into the sheath These cables are designed for every type of communications networks with G657A2 fibre. Micro module cables reduce the time needed for deployment, ease of installation and connectorization. Regarding to the products structure, cables are composed by micromodules (which contain the optical fibres) stranded in a cable core without central element, as well as a water blocking yarns and/or tapes. Furthermore, the optical fibre cables have fibreglass reinforcement elements embedded in the outer sheath, and eventual aramid yarns in the cable code. The outer covering is made from black high density polyethylene UV-resistant sheath. The expected life span of the product is 25 years.","open_xpd_uuid":"ec3ac6jx","resilient_flooring_thickness":null,"masonry_cement_astm_c91_type":null,"cmu_glass_powder_containing":null,"steel_rebar_diameter_min":null,"density":null,"access_flooring_finish_material":null,"concrete_compressive_strength_other_d":null,"wall_base_material":null,"gwp":"372

Control\n\nAccess Control\nAccess Control cables contain multiple cables each designed for a specific application. These applications\ninclude: card readers, door contacts, REX (request exit), and locking power.\nAlthough each cable has a separate application and cable requirements, they are installed in the same vicinity.\nAccess Control cables are grouped together to make their installation easier. There are two main methods of\ngrouping the cables together: applying an overall jacket or applying a substrate between the cables to “stick”\nthem together (Banana Peel®). Jacketed versions (ex: AFJ) are generally larger than the Banana Peel\nversions (ex: AFS) and are more difficult to install since the jacket needs to be removed.\nThe listed Access Control cables have four different cables grouped together. Each cable ranges from #16 to\n#22 AWG and has 16 to 18 conductors. Insulation material is Flamarrest® PVC. Foil shields with drain wires\nare used when necessary and the jackets/substrates are Flamarrest® PVC.\no Part numbers: 638AFS, 658AFJ, 658AFS, 658AMJ, 658GFS,

Control\n\nAccess Control\nAccess Control cables contain multiple cables each designed for a specific application. These applications\ninclude: card readers, door contacts, REX (request exit), and locking power.\nAlthough each cable has a separate application and cable requirements, they are installed in the same vicinity.\nAccess Control cables are grouped together to make their installation easier. There are two main methods of\ngrouping the cables together: applying an overall jacket or applying a substrate between the cables to “stick”\nthem together (Banana Peel®). Jacketed versions (ex: AFJ) are generally larger than the Banana Peel\nversions (ex: AFS) and are more difficult to install since the jacket needs to be removed.\nThe listed Access Control cables have four different cables grouped together. Each cable ranges from #16 to\n#22 AWG and has 16 to 18 conductors. Insulation material is Flamarrest® PVC. Foil shields with drain wires\nare used when necessary and the jackets/substrates are Flamarrest® PVC.\no Part numbers: 638AFS, 658AFJ, 658AFS, 658AMJ, 658GFS,
